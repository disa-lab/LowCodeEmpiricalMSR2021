326366,Experiences with Zoho Creator?,"<p>I wish to create an online system to track some things (e.g., a database with children, where each child has 1 or more visits from doctors). I want the users to be able to enter data as well as search for it, especially from mobile devices. So, this is a custom mobile online DB app of modest but non-zero size.</p>

<p>I've looked into DabbleDB and Zoho Creator, looking for an easy solution that will have low-cost maintenance.</p>

<p>Although I feel my app is not too complicated, I find that if I want to do something slightly out of their mainstream, I hit walls. For example, dealing with many-to-many relationships, or with 100K records, or doing an involved mathematical calculation for a field.</p>

<p>What are people's experiences with these online DB apps? Should I keep pushing ahead, or just write a custom app myself?</p>
","<p>I also tried building a simple web application with Zoho Creator and got so frustrated that I am now looking for a different solution. I consider Zoho Creator to be at a point right now suitable for educational purposes but I would not consider using it for a functional application.</p>

1236439,How do generate screen elements dynamically in the OutSystems platform?,"<p>I am using the OutSystems platform and I am having trouble implementing something like a dynamic questionnaire. Admin users should be able to login and add new questions(no limit to number of questions), modify existing questions/answers and delete existing questions. Answer Choices can be of various types like radio buttons, dropdowns, text boxes etc. Normal users should see the updated questionnaire upon next login.</p>

<p>I was thinking of creating something like a template to which we can add dynamic controls at runtime. We can use dynamic page rendering features in .net etc to implement this, but we are looking to see how I can implement this in OutSystems as here we add most of the controls as static controls. The major hurdle is that the number of web blocks that we need to create is not fixed. It may depend on a user selection.</p>

Someone asked for a Google map on the page showing our upcoming engagements.<p>I know Zoho provides an API that allows accessing its data from the outside, but I actually need to integrate the map on the data-entry form.<p>If anyone could provide a pointer to any mashup with Zoho CRM (be it Google MAps, Bing Maps, or any similar web service), I would be extremely grateful.</p>
","<p>I know this is an ancient question, but since there's no answers and this is pretty much all that came up on google when searching for Zoho CRM integration with Google Maps I'll take a stab at this anyway. I recently got a similiar request, but in this case they wanted to display the leads on a page outside of Zoho. </p>

<p>I created a Java servlet and JSP that runs on Google App Engine. The servlet will connect to Zoho CRM to retrieve all leads and geocode the addresses they are registered with. The client-side Javascript is then taking care of creating the markers on the map for all the addresses. </p>

<p>This should be easy, BUT Zoho decided that creating proper HTML was too big a pain in the ass, I guess, and their HTML contains things like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" maxlength=""50"" style=""width: 100%;"" class=""textField"" id=""property(Phone)"" name=""property(Phone)""/&gt;

<p>The ID's contain spaces and parentheses, which aren't valid in ID attributes, and is preventing me from using either document.getElementById() to select them or from using jQuery to select them.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas for how I could grab that element? Obviously I could grab it via its index in its parent element, or by traversing the DOM, but both of those would mean that if the order of the fields changed, the Greasemonkey script would stop working correctly because it would then be targeting the wrong elements.</p>
","<p>You can escape the spaces and parentheses using backslashes:</p>

<p>We have went through their courses and did all the examples but from experience these types of things only show part of the picture.</p>

<p>Are there any serious pitfalls that we may not be aware of?</p>
","<p><em>DISCLAIMER: I work for OutSystems</em></p>

<p>Every development tool/language/stack/... involves some tradeoffs at some point. Therefore, depending on what you're looking for, or particularly interested in, you may consider some aspect of a platform as an unforgivable pitfall where others might see it as a godsend blessing, or vice-versa. Thus, only by knowing what you really like and what you consider essential, may I try to guess what you'll miss and what you'll consider a pitfall.</p>

<p>Since we usually only notice the lack of something the first time we try to use it, I'd recommend trying to use the platform to hack something at your will without following the tutorials and the courses to the letter. If while creating something different you find anything you dislike, we'll be happy to hear it from you!</p>

<p>TL;DR: If you think the tutorials for a tool aren't showing you something, play with it a bit without following them.</p>

e^(Log(1024)/10) = 2.</p>

","<p>You actually can't do what you're suggesting.  When using an <code>&lt;input type=""file"" .../&gt;</code> the uploaded file is never loaded into the HTML.  Instead it's included as part of the POST request.  So what you want to actually do is craft a complete POST request, and submit that post to your action (http://zohoservice).</p>

<p>This is doable, but it's going to be a bit of work on your end, and you'll need to understand how to create a MIME multipart POST request.  And if there are any anti-botting technologies or view state tracking (kinds of things) then you'll run into some trouble there.</p>

8005085,"convert xml response (from ZohoCRM) to simple ""key=value"" pairs (for SurveyGizmo) using php or Zoho Creator","<p>This deals with exchanging data between two web services.</p>

<p>I'm stumped as to where to even start.  Any assistance, pointers, or even complete solutions :) much appreciated.</p>

<p>I'll describe in plain language...</p>

<p>SurveyGizmo can post (insert) data to ZohoCRM.</p>

<p>After insert, Zoho responds with either an xml response that includes an ID of the inserted record.</p>

<p>Gizmo needs that ID for subsequent updates.</p>

<p>The problem is, Gizmo will only accept a response in a simple ""key1=value1,key2=value2"" format.</p>

<p>I'd like to have a php script on my server (or ZohoCreator deluge script) receive Gizmo's post, pass it through to ZohoCRM, receive the xml response from Zoho, convert it to key=value, and return it to Gizmo.</p>

<p>This is what Gizmo posts to ZohoCRM:</p>

<pre><code>https://crm.zoho.com/crm/private/xml/Cases/insertRecords?newFormat=2&amp;apikey=KEYGOESHERE&amp;ticket=TICKETGOESHERE&amp;duplicateCheck=2&amp;xmlData=

&lt;FL val=""Case Owner""&gt;myemail&lt;/FL&gt;
&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/Cases&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is what Zoho CRM responds after insert:</p>

<p>(the 00000 from Id is what I need to return to Gizmo as ""Id=000000""):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;response uri=""/crm/private/xml/Cases/insertRecords""&gt;
&lt;result&gt;
&lt;message&gt;Record(s) inserted successfully&lt;/message&gt;

<p>Is there any way they can block cURL requests? Is there any other way I can call that URL using a POST or maybe a GET request?</p>

<p>The cURL code I have tried is as below:</p>

<pre><code>$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
$data = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
</code></pre>
","<p>Servers cannot block cURL requests per se, but they can block any request that they do not like. If the server checks for some parameters that your cURL request does not satisfy, it could decide to respond differently.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, this difference in behavior is triggered by the presence (or absence) and values of the HTTP request headers. For example, the server might check that the <code>User-Agent</code> header is present and has a valid value (it could also check lots of other things).</p>

<p>To find out what the HTTP request coming from the browser looks like, use an HTTP debugging proxy like <a href=""http://fiddler2.com/fiddler2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fiddler</a> or your browser's developer tools.</p>

<p>To add your own headers to your cURL request, use</p>

<pre><code>curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('HeaderName: HeaderValue'));

<p>As noted, the url pointing to QuickBase returns an error, but the url pointing to the xml file returns the xml as expected. But here's the kicker: the xml file (testdata.xml) was created by pointing my browser directly to the specified url: <a href=""https://www.quickbase.com/db/&lt;mydbid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quickbase.com/db/&lt;mydbid</a>>?a=API_DoQuery&amp;query={7.EX.235445}&amp;apptoken=&lt;myapptoken> and saving the results to testdata.xml. It seems to me the jquery ajax call SHOULD produce the same results as the testdata.xml file. But it does not.</p>

<p>The Firebug xml pane shows that the call when executed against the QuickBase site returns ""XML Parsing Error: syntax error Location: moz-nullprincipal:{3e0d38f1-0e36-4adb-965e-d0e7d68ab0cb} Line Number 1, Column 1:Reload the page to get source for: <a href=""https://www.quickbase.com/db"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quickbase.com/db</a>...""</p>

11248169,Automating Salesforce Security Checks,"<p>I need to create some automated method for checking certain security settings within a given Salesforce org(s). The four big ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>IP Restrictions within each profile </li>
<li>Mobile User setting disabled</li>
<li>Mobile Lite disabled</li>
<li>Chatter Disabled</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the first two can be accomplished through the API (SOQL to get all profiles and check loginIpRanges[] length >0 and SOQL to get all users and check isMobileUser property for each one), but I can't find anything in the API for the other two and wonder if I would have to screen scrape it.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on the best approach to accomplish this? A local Python or other script that connects remotely via the API and a screen scraper or Selenium script for the non-API items? An Apex or VisualForce page that is installed within each org?</p>

<p>I am new to Salesforce and Apex, so before I start down one road and doing it within Salesforce vs via the API I would really appreciate any guidance. </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>I think you'll have to take a mixed approach to solving this, perhaps wrapped up in some larger python script.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the metadata API to get all of the Profile objects and parse for loginIPRanges. You can use Apache ANT and the Force.com migration tool commands to do this. You can also get the SecuritySettings from the same API and method and get a lot of the things in the Security Health Check, if you need them. The results will be returned in XML, which you can easily parse in your python script.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the API and a SOQL query to check for the isMobileUser permission, use python to parse/output results. Beatbox is a good library for connecting to the standard API.</p></li>
<li><p>For the last two, I think you'll need to go with some screen scraping/browser automation and parsing. Hopefully someone has a better answer for this, as I'm not familiar enough to help with how to accomplish this aspect. The screens are in standard locations so it should be repeatable as long as future updates don't move things.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally you'll be able to combine these into one large script that fires off beatbox, then fires off ant/migration tool, and some browser automation script. </p>

We are probably going to use git as SCM and ideally we would like to have a good integration between the code changes in SCM and the tasks/bugs in the project management. I've narrowed down the search to a few options:</p>

<p><strong>Redmine</strong>: Mainstream open source, free software development management tool. Tasks, bugs, wiki, blogs, time tracking, git integration, pretty much everything we need. Not hosted. Could be deployed in-house or in a PaaS like CloudFoundry.</p>

<p><strong>JIRA</strong>: Lots of features. Integration with Git, Eclipse, plenty of plugins, plenty of functionality. 1 to 4 $/month/person/application. Limited integration with google apps.</p>

<p><strong>Zoho Projects</strong>: New generation of management apps, fully integrated with google apps (calendar, docs, tasks). Task Management, Document Sharing, Time Tracking &amp; Billing, Bug Tracking Software, Gantt Charts, Project Wiki, Project Chat, Project Calendar, Project Forums. With bug tracker, ticketing, git integration. Quite expensive (Projects $299 / year, Bug Tracker Add-on  $299 / year)</p>

<p><strong>Yodiz</strong>: Looks perfect for scrum (scrum board, release board, backlog, planning board, epics, sprints, releases). It has time sheets and integration with SCM, with automatic posting in the tasks/defects when the code is committed (<a href=""http://app.yodiz.com/thirdparty/pages/git.vz?pid=6"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://app.yodiz.com/thirdparty/pages/git.vz?pid=6</a>). Pricing 5$/user/month + 22$ month for GitHub. There is another similar software fogcreek (<a href=""http://www.fogcreek.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.fogcreek.com</a>) but it's VERY expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Assembla</strong>: Everything under one roof. SCM repository + all the agile functionality (wiki, tickets, files, etc). 9$ to 99$ per month, 10$/user/month for assembla portfolio. Quite popular.</p>

<p>Assembla looks like a very good option, but I don't seem to find a loot of feedback about it. Could you give me your advice on Assembla, the other tools and maybe other different options. </p>

","<p>Assembla is good at integrating your SCM with your ticket/bug tracking.  This is it's specialty.  You can use Merge Requests for Code Review and Release Management.

<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>I have implemented the below given answer.
I have a link. When I click that link it is redirected to destination A. I have an input paramater which is a boolean parameter. I pass 'true' as its value. The destination A which is a webscreen has a webblock B. On that particular webblock, for the InitialActiveTab property I have checked whether the input parameter is True or False.
For true I am passing WebblockC.Id as the value.</p>

<p>But, on the browser underneth the webblock it is showing this error.</p>

<p>Invalid use of RichWidgets\Tabs_ClientSide: The initial tab must have the 'title' extended property defined.</p>

<p>I have set the OnTabActivation property as desired to the system, but still it does not works.</p>
","<p>That behavior can be accomplished this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>add an optional input parameter to the webscreens where you have the tabs to specify which tab to be selected when the user lands on the page</li>
<li>feed that parameter to the <code>InitialactiveTab</code> input of the *Tabs_ClientSide* web block</li>
<li>in all links where you want the target to open with an initial different tab, specify which tab to open by filling the optional input parameter you created with the title of the tab to be activated</li>
</ul>

The list is big, and when I scroll down I am able to see the contents of the list but I am not able to judge the column headers as they are not visible once you scroll down.</p>

<p>So is there any solution for this problem ? I have tried with a 'Fixed table' widget but it went in vain.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>This is a generic <em>fixed table header</em> problem. You can solve it employing solutions that aren't specific to the OutSystems paltform.

","<p>An <code>app</code> in Salesforce.com is nothing but a container which contains in it - a name, a logo, and an ordered set of tabs.</p>

<p>All the metadata such as <code>Objects</code>, <code>Visualforce Pages</code>, <code>Classes</code>, etc are independent of an <code>app</code>. An <code>app</code> just helps to group things together <strong>visually</strong>. But internally the metadata has nothing to do with an <code>app</code> i.e. you can have the same <code>tab</code>, <code>VF Page</code> in multiple apps.</p>

","<p>Interesting, so it is always keeping same copy of your DataSet, which is been refreshed every 5 seconds and displayed, that means your ViewState is been refreshed also every 5 seconds, it looks to me you might be submitting same values last received not containing any changes, I'll go one of two routes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stop the poller when edit mode or making changes also blocking the record for editing so no one else could overwrite your changes.</li>
<li>Split the viewState into two separate ViewStates, one is going to load records, second one is going to be used for editing selected record, when saved first ViewState is going to be refreshed with last changes made on second ViewState, you can accomplish this by using multiple forms and a syncing mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Proposed solution for using option (1), the poller stays active it is not interfering with the record, still missing a lock mechanism for the record when selected </p>

23984516,How to make Chrome Extension run for each new Iframe added?,"<p>I created a Chrome Extension as a solution to override the helpText bubbles in SalesForce Console pages. The helpText bubbles show up the text without the ability to link URLs. It looks like this: </p>

","<p>It is possible (I have not tested it, but it sounds plausible from a few questions I've seen here) that Chrome does not automatically inject manifest-specified code into newly-created <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>In that case, you will have to use a background script to <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#method-executeScript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">re-inject your script</a>:</p>

<p>Now, there is the need to enable some users to access it through a NAT, which is configured to serve requests on port 8200. The requests are forwarded to the server with no problem, except when the response is a redirect (HTTP 302). In these cases, the Location Header of the response is set with the port where the application is actually being served which is port 443. When the client's browser tries to access this URL that was set in the Location Header, it will fail since the NAT is only serving the requests in port 8200.</p>

<p>In sum:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client browser accesses <code>https://myserver:8200/myapp</code> ;</li>
<li>NAT translates the URL and forwards to <code>https://myserver:443/myapp</code> ;</li>
<li>Application replies with a 302 redirect to <code>https://myserver:443/redirect</code> ;</li>
<li>Client browser accesses <code>https://myserver:443/redirect</code> ;</li>
<li>NAT blocks this access because it is expecting port 8200 ;</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what i tried to do; I installed the URL Rewrite module in IIS and created the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>An Inbound rule to store the request's Host Header (in these cases it's <code>https://myserver:8200</code>) to a server variable ORIGINAL_HOST.</li>
<li>An Outbound rule to replace the host part of the URL that is sent in the response's Location Header (<code>https://myserver:443/redirect</code>) with the value stored in my server variable ORIGINAL_HOST. The rule is only applied in case of a redirect.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem i am facing now is that the minute i enable this Rule, all AJAX requests stop working even it the rule does not apply to them and even when not accessing the application through the NAT.
When this happens, i am seeing through IE's Network tab in Developer Tools that the request header and body is ok, response header is ok, but the response body is empty and should not be. Also, if i try to debug the AJAX request at the server using a breakpoint, it is not stopping at the breakpoint.</p>

<p>So, my question: Is using the URL Rewrite the best way to solve the NAT/URL problem? If so, how can i solve the AJAX situation? If not, then how do i solve the redirect problem?</p>

<p>*edit: here is my rule configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3vS5aEfCF76bXpXQWYtR1FXWkE/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Inbound rule to store the host value</a></li>

<p>In the DetailScreen1, you can use those context variables as they'll be available.</p>

<p>Here's an example: the dropdown in the first screen contains a list of sections, and after selecting one you would navigate to another page:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqwHv.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqwHv.png"" alt=""Sample result""></a></p>

<p>In the ""right arrow"", we can set the following OnSelect property:</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(ProductsScreen, ScreenTransition.Fade, { selectedSection: Dropdown1.Selected.Value })
</code></pre>

<p>In the ProductsScreen, you can then have a gallery whose items are filtered based on that value that was passed:</p>

<pre><code>Items: Filter(AllProducts, Section = selectedSection)

  var label = desc.Label;
  var confirmButton = desc.Confirm;

  label.text = msg;

  app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);

</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>It'd be great if this was a bit easier, but the best bet is to use Custom Properties (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/viewfragments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/viewfragments</a>).</p>

<p>You can set up a custom property of type ""Dynamic"" and call it anything, take ""onConfirmCallback"", for example. Then you can set the function on that custom property:</p>

<p>Code to invoke dialog:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback = function(param) {
  alert(param); 
};
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the onClick for the close button:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback(""hi"");
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that there are slightly better ways to set up labels than in your example, also using custom properties.</p>

<p>Create custom properties for any widget properties you want to customize, and then bind those custom properties (@properties.propertyName) to the widget property. For example you might have a confirmText property, with the confirm buttons text property boudn to @properties.confirmText.</p>

<p>Then when you invoke your dialog, you can just set those custom properties. Quick modification of your example code using properties for everything:</p>

<pre><code>function confirmationDialog(msg, confirmFunction)
{
  var properties = app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties;
  properties.text = msg;
  properties.confirmCallback = confirmFunction;

  app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);
}

<p>Any help is appreciated. Very new at this and pointing me on where to get the info would be great. Thanks</p>
","<p>I recommend you to run a server script that would query the datasource that has the emails. The script will look something like this: </p>

<pre><code>function getEmails(){

  var query = app.models.&lt;yourmodel&gt;.newQuery();
  var results = query.run();

  var allEmails = [];

  if(results.length &gt; 0){  
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++){    
      var uniqueEmail = results[i].&lt;emailfieldname&gt;;
      allEmails.push(uniqueEmail);      
    }
  }

  return allEmails.join();      

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then add a script to the button widget ""onclick"" event that will run the server script and manipulate the returned data. Something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>function poulateToField(response){

  &lt;widget path&gt;.text/value = response;

}

google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(poulateToField).getEmails();
</code></pre>

<p>The above <strong>widget path</strong> would be the path to the ""To:"" widget, which can be a text box, text area, etc. In my case, I used a text area and the path was this ""<strong><em>widget.parent.descendants.TextArea1.value</em></strong>""</p>

<p>I hope this helps. If you have more questions, just let me know! :)</p>

41803929,Query as Widget Datasource,"<p>I'm trying to define a widget's datasource as the result of a query, but I'm not sure if it's posible. </p>

<p>I'm working with SQL views and a Table, I'd like to show the values of the IDs that I have on the table that come from the views.</p>

<pre><code>function queryValue(source, model, key){
  console.log(""source "" + source);
  app.datasources[model].query.filters.id._equals = source;
  app.datasources[model].load(function () {
    console.log(app.datasources.users.items[0][key]);
    return app.datasources.users.items[0][key];
  });
  app.datasources[model].query.clearFilters();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Calling it like:</p>

<pre><code>queryValue(@datasource.item.[the_id], ""[the_SQLView_Datasouce]"", ""[the_field_i_want]"");
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the widget is a table, so the fucntion would repeat the amount of items in the talbe</p>

<p>The problem is that either I get the same result as meny times as the amount of items or the first one does not work!</p>

<p>And the second problem is that the result does not over write the widget text to show.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7HFv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7HFv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's a very simple function and I did found some workarounds but not with the datasource feature and they work too slowly, any sugestions? Is it possible to do such thing with the datasource?</p>
","<p>If I understand the question correctly, you probably want to do the query on the server side. The issue with the sample code posted is it's triggering a load on a single data source multiple times before any of the loads can return. When this is done, the data source is only loaded with the results from one of the loads, I believe the last one. So you're probably seeing the results from the last query you did for all your callbacks.</p>

<p>So instead your code should instead be a server side script, and should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>function queryValue(source, model, key){
  console.log(""source "" + source);
  var query = app.models.newQuery();
  query.filters.id._equals = source;
  var results = query.run;
  return results[0].key;
}

","<p>Luciano,</p>

<p>Is your OutSystems environment on-premises or in the cloud? Either way, you need to make sure that this server is able to reach - it as connectivity - to your MySQL database server. Using localhost or 127.0.0.1 is pretty much the same thing as this is an address for the machine where the request is running, which is, in this case, the OutSystems server. Do you have the MySQL database on your local machine? This is not a good approach as you will need to have an address that won't change otherwise the connection won't be stable and you'd have to reconfigure it all the time.</p>

41867303,set default value for detail in master/detail relationship form widget dialog button,"<p>I have a master/detail relation similar to the relations sample provided.
In my example department has a one to many relationship with employee
I have a form widget(department) which has a button to insert an employee.</p>

<p>when I click on that button the correct dialog form is displayed but I am allowed to enter any department which I do not want.
I am looking to have the relation defaulted to the ""parent"" widget where it was clicked and ideally not be editable.</p>
","<p>It's hard to give an exact answer without seeing your app, but you should probably replace the dropdown in the form with a label, that will make it not editable. You can bind the value of the label to the relation just like the value of the dropdown was bound.</p>

<p>A slightly easier option would be disabling the dropdown (look for the Enabled probably in the property inspector). But that could be confusing for your users since they might think it should be editable.</p>

<p>(Alternatively, you could just remove the field altogether if it's not important to show the relation.)</p>

<p>I think this only answers the ""not editable"" part of your question, if you want it to be pre-filled you either need to do some scripting, or use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#relation_datasources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relation data sources</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest using relation data sources, so right now you probably have something like:</p>

<p><code>app.datasources.Emp.create()</code>, which creates a new employee.</p>

<p>Instead, you can use <code>widget.datasource.relations.Emp.create()</code>, which will create a new employee which has a relation to the current item in widget.datasource. If this button is placed in your department form widget, then that means it will create an employee related to whatever department is shown in the form.</p>

<p>Note that none of this stops users from changing the department of an employee, it just changes the UI. In lots of cases that is enough, but you may also want to add some server-side security controls if it's important to limit which users can create employees, change departments, etc: See <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/security/secure-app-data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/security/secure-app-data</a></p>

41881534,Had trouble linking widget to a queried datasource,"<p>I'm sure everyone already knows this, but it took me a while to figure out so I thought I would share. </p>

<p>Basically I was trying tell a widget to change color based on the current status of an entry in my model.</p>

<p>But I needed Widget 1 to change for Room 201, Widget 2 to change for Room 202, etc.</p>

<p>Ex: </p>

<p>Room: 201, Status: Available = Widget 1: Green
Room: 202, Status: Booked = Widget 2: Red</p>

<p>I could get the widgets to change color (thanks to borrowing from the code in the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/project-list/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project List Sample</a>), but I was confused how to change their individual datasources to a query. They would basically only show the color corresponding to the currently selected item in the database/table.</p>

<p>So, here is what I did:</p>

<p>Went into my Model, went under Datasources and added a new Datasource.</p>

<p>Ex name: Room201</p>

<p>Then in the Query builder I put in the Field I was trying to narrow by. </p>

<p>ex: Room = :Query</p>

<p>(Room = my field, and I believe the "":Query"" is the just name of the query, someone can correct me if I'm wrong)</p>

<p>Then you'll see a box below that window where you can add a binding. So THAT is where I put in my query. </p>

<p>ex: @datasources.Facilities.query.filters.Room._equals = 201</p>

<p>(Note: I had to create a separate Datasource for each room)</p>

<p>Then I went to my widget and chose the queried datasource (Room201) for the datasource.</p>

<p>So Widget 1 = the datasource Room201, Widget 2 = the datasource Room202, etc. </p>

<p>Done. </p>

<p>I need to dynamically update my data source, which I am currently doing with PowerShell. My data source is not static and updating records by hand is time-consuming and error prone. The driving force behind my question is that the SharePoint list view threshold is 5,000 records <strong>however</strong> you are limited to 500 visible and searchable records when using SharePoint lists in the Gallery View and my data source contains greater than 500 <strong>but</strong> <em>less than 1000 records</em>.

<p>One way of dealing with this kind of errors in OutSystems is inspecting the database itself. There's a system table called ossys_espace. Get your espace id from there. Then query ossys_entity to see which is the physical table name for that entity and check if there's something wrong with it.</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that you've created a table in the past that is causing the error. Check for the entities with the flag deleted set to true in that table.

42006707,Why is select button in App Maker Drive Picker not enabled?,"<p>I have a Drive Picker widget in Google App Maker that pops up and lets me select a folder.  However, the Select button is greyed out.</p>

My views is set to FOLDERS and my security is set to run as the user's account.

42010994,How Can I Duplicate A Item/Record?,"<p>(Deleted my old question to simplify it. )</p>

<p>I enter data in a table, I then want to make an exact duplicate of that data in a new item/record/row*.</p>

<p>*not sure the proper term.</p>

<p>Is there any way to accomplish this? </p>
","<p>Sorry for the slow response. Here is what you should do:</p>

<p>Add a ""copy"" button in the row. In the onClick on that button, add this code:</p>

<pre><code>var createDataSource = widget.datasource.modes.create;
var rowDataSource = widget.datasource;
createDataSource.item.foo = rowDataSource.item.foo;
createDataSource.item.bar = rowDataSource.item.bar;
// And so on for each field
createDataSource.createItem();
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably make sure of javascript for-in to loop through all the properties of the item in so you don't have to manually specify each record, but I didn't have time to experiment with this.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The above code won't show the copied record in the list immediately, because I used row's create data source, instead of the <em>lists</em> create data source. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>var rowDataSource = widget.datasource;
// Instead of using the row  datasource for create, explicitly use the data source of your list.
var listDatasource = app.datasources.NameOfYourListsDataSource;
var createDataSource = listDatasource.modes.create; 

createDataSource.item.foo = rowDataSource.item.foo;
createDataSource.item.bar = rowDataSource.item.bar;
// And so on for each field
createDataSource.createItem();

<p>Why is it giving me an error.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>The issue has been fixed.</p>

<p>The problem was I disregarded the error of my 'Address' table. </p>

<p>It has a problem with its foreign key. </p>

<p>Every time there's an error in the compilation, I just republish.</p>

<p>And the application gets publish successfully.</p>

<p>But, this isn't true. I believe the cycle of the entire compilation is interrupted with this error.</p>

<p>So, now every time I will see an error in the compilation -- I should fix (lesson learned)..</p>

<p>I updated my 'Address' table which has the error. Now, I can successfully add attributes to my 'Contact' table.</p>

<p>I hope this will shed some light to someone who's having the same problem as I had.</p>

","<p>The Winter 17 release included the ability to create Actions based on Lightning Components. This is most likely the way you will want to go to convert your existing JavaScript buttons. I would suggest you check out this new Trailhead that was just released which is specifically about <a href=""https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/lex_javascript_button_migration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lightning Alternatives to JavaScript buttons</a>. </p>

<p>I am also working on a course for Pluralsight about Lightning development and this is one of the areas I plan on covering since it is so applicable to a lot of people right now. I am not sure if you realize this but by next year, any JavaScript buttons you have will no longer work (even in classic). It is part of a <a href=""https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Hyperlink-Formula-Fields-for-JavaScript-Disablement&amp;language=en_US&amp;type=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3 phased approach</a> that Salesforce is implementing to phase them out for security reasons.</p>

42170805,Applying Script Library for Timeline,"<p>This is a follow up to my previous question. I apologize if this is too complex to answer here. </p>

<pre><code>google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['timeline']});
      google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
      function drawChart() {
        var container = document.getElementById('timeline');
        var chart = new google.visualization.Timeline(container);
        var dataTable = new google.visualization.DataTable();

<p>The app works correctly in Preview mode, but when I deploy it, the Suggest Box doesn't suggest anything!</p>

<p>I have deployed it once before (without a select box as I recall) and it worked correctly.</p>

<p>I tried redeploying to the original deployment and deploying to a new deployment, same result.</p>

<p>Am I missing some security setting or something?</p>
","<p>I am using Drive Tables as my datasource. The kind people at Google sent me a couple of links which helped me to understand what's going on: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/deployment"" rel=""noreferrer"">previewing and publishing your application</a> and <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/security/identity"" rel=""noreferrer"">running as user or developer</a>.</p>

<p>The crux of the issue is that when you deploy an app and run it as user (default), it doesn't take any Drive Table data with it. If you want to add Drive Table data to the deployed app, you have to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open App Maker</li>
<li>Go to App Settings</li>
<li>Go to Deployments</li>
<li>Select your most recent deployment and click: “EXPORT DATA”</li>
<li>Make sure you select Preview from the Deployments drop down list.</li>
<li>Click Export</li>
<li>This will export all your Preview data to a new Google Spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Now go to your Drive models in the App Maker and click “IMPORT DATA FROM SHEET”</li>
<li>Here you can choose to import data to your Deployed version.</li>
<li>After completing the import process, you will have all your data in the Deployed app. </li>

42530654,Power App - generate PDF,"<p>I got an assignment to see if I can make power app that will generate some PDF file for end user to see. 
After through research on this topic I found out that this is not an easy to achieve :)
In order to make power app generate and download/show generated pdf I made these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created power app with just one button :) to call Azure function from step 2</li>
<li>Created Azure function that will generate and return pdf as StreamContent</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to power app limitations (or I just could not find the way) there was no way for me to get pdf from response inside power app.
After this, I changed my Azure function to create new blob entry but know I have problem to get URL for that new entry inside Azure function in order to return this to power app and then use inside power app Download function</p>

<p>My Azure function code is below</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Aspose.Words;

public static async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log, Stream outputBlob)
{
    log.Info($""C# HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri={req.RequestUri}"");

    var dataDir = @""D:/home"";
    var docFile = $""{dataDir}/word-templates/WordAutomationTest.docx"";
    var uid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString().Replace(""-"", """");
    var pdfFile = $""{dataDir}/pdf-export/WordAutomationTest_{uid}.pdf"";
    var doc = new Document(docFile);
    doc.Save(pdfFile);

    var result = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    var stream = new FileStream(pdfFile, FileMode.Open);

    stream.CopyTo(outputBlob);

    // result.Content = new StreamContent(stream);
    // result.Content.Headers.ContentDisposition = new ContentDispositionHeaderValue(""attachment"");
    // result.Content.Headers.ContentDisposition.FileName = Path.GetFileName(pdfFile);
    // result.Content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(""application/octet-stream"");
    // result.Content.Headers.ContentLength = stream.Length;

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I left old code (the one that streams pdf back under comments just as reference of what I tried)</p>

<p>Is there any way to get download URL for newly generated blob entry inside Azure function?
Is there any better way to make power app generate and download/show generated PDF?</p>

<p>P.S. I tried to use PDFViewer control inside power app, but this control is completely useless cause U can not set Document value via function</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Response from @mathewc helped me a lot to finally wrap this up. All details are below.
New Azure function that works as expected</p>

","<p>Your solution is a good one, another solution, depending on the number of existing records, is to use the multi-select widget.

","<p>The key to this is to understand that this:</p>

<p>Is just shorthand for this:</p>

<pre><code>$xml-&gt;result[0]-&gt;recorddetail[0]-&gt;FL[0];

<p>That should make it obvious that to access the 2nd <code>recorddetail</code> (with index <code>1</code>), you could write this:</p>

<pre><code>$xml-&gt;result-&gt;recorddetail[1]-&gt;FL[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the magic SimpleXML provides you can also find out how many there are:</p>

<pre><code>count($xml-&gt;result-&gt;recorddetail);

<p>And most relevantly for your case, loop over them:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ( $xml-&gt;result-&gt;recorddetail as $recorddetail ) {
    $product_id = $recorddetail-&gt;FL[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a final tip, you probably want the <code>$product_id</code> variable to hold an ordinary string, not a SimpleXML object; you get that with a ""string cast"", like this:</p>

<pre><code>$product_id = (string)$recorddetail-&gt;FL[0];

42809056,How to create bulkconnection with accesstoken in salesforce,"<p>I need to create BulkConnection for bulk API into salesforce.</p>

<p>We can able to create BulkConnection using ConnectorConfig with basic SOAP authentication.</p>

<pre><code>        ConnectorConfig config = new ConnectorConfig();

        config.setUsername(""USERNAME"");
        config.setPassword(""PASSWORD+TOKEN"");


        config.setCompression(true);
        config.setTraceFile(""traceLogs.txt"");

        config.setTraceMessage(true);
        config.setPrettyPrintXml(true);

        config.setAuthEndpoint(""https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/39.0"");
        PartnerConnection connection = new PartnerConnection(config);

        String soapEndpoint = config.getServiceEndpoint();
        String apiVersion = ""39.0"";
        String restEndpoint = soapEndpoint.substring(0, soapEndpoint.indexOf(""Soap/"")) + ""async/"" + apiVersion;
        config.setRestEndpoint(restEndpoint);

        bulkConnection = new BulkConnection(config);

If I use account A to preview the project it works fine, yet account B with the exact same cloudSQL credentials is unable to preview, account B is the owner of the project.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cHMg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cHMg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They both have the same IAM roles in the cloudSQL project and both accounts were able to preview last week. 
I've tried deleting cache, navigation files and another browser using account B.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>I'm going to add a new answer to resolve this because I think it's worthwhile to keep the previous answer and discussion intact. The issue here was that the accounts which did not work have the ""Viewer"" role in the IAM &amp; Admin section of the Google Cloud SQL project. The Viewer role gives (among other permissions) read access to Cloud SQL, but not write access.</p>

<p>The best role to use if restricted access is required, but they need full access to read/write SQL, is the Google Cloud SQL Client role. See <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/project-access-control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/project-access-control</a> for more information on roles and what access they give.</p>

<p>Thanks for Juan for help tracking all this down.</p>

<p>Edit: It's also worth mentioning that the reason this works in the Editor, but not in Preview/Deployments is the editor is explicitly whitelisted for access (as one of the steps we ask you to do in the documentation), so it doesn't use role permissions for a particular account, while access through your deployments is not explicitly whitelisted in this way, so role permissions are enforced.</p>

There is lots of space between the two options, so I would like it to be shorter but it is ignoring the height option.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for any pointers or suggestions.</p>
","<p>You can reduce the padding between the items with:</p>

<pre><code>.app-RadioGroup-Item {
  padding: 0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Although I suggest 2 or 4px (it's currently 8px).</p>

<p>If you want to mess with the actual size of the items, you can style the input element, something like:</p>

<pre><code>.app-RadioGroup-Item input {
  height: 12px;
  width: 12px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note you'd probably want to tweak more than just the height and width, and this doesn't look very good. I'd suggest sticking to only styling the padding if that's enough for you.</p>

<p>As an example let's say the following fields are in the form; Location, Action, Item, Username. </p>

<p>This is what I am imaging and would like to do;</p>

<p>I would like the first two fields to be filled by selecting buttons on a previous screens instead of a drop down menu in the edit form view. the last two field can be filled by inputting text on a thirds screen. </p>

<p>The flow: </p>

<p><strong>Screen1</strong>; presents two 4 locations in the form of buttons*doesn't necessarily have to be a button but function like one.</p>

<p>4 locations: NY, LA, AZ, LN</p>

<p>when users selects ""NY"" button, ""NY"" is filled/stored in to the ""location"" field in the form and the screen navigates to the next page where the user will select the actions. </p>

<p><strong>Screen2</strong>; presents two 2 actions in the form of button. </p>

<p>2 Actions: remove, add</p>

<p>when users selects ""remove"" button, ""remove"" is filled/stored in to the ""action"" field in the form and the screen navigates to the next page where the user will fill the other two fields in a text field. </p>

<p><strong>Screen3</strong>; has two text fields where user can fill in the rest of the information for item and user name. Location and Action should be prefilled at this point. When the user submits the form all data is submitted and a row is created in the excel table with all the information captured. </p>

42996482,Using BigQuery API with Google App Maker,"<p>Has anybody had any experience with using BigQuery with Google App Maker? Specifically, creating a data source for a Google Drive Table through Apps Script.</p>

<p>I use a script in google sheets to use BigQuery API, run a job and return the output to a sheet, but i'm unsure how to modify this to work in App Maker - any advice?</p>

<p>best wishes</p>

<p>Dave</p>
","<p>Sorry for the vague answer, maybe someone else can provide a better one with a concrete example.</p>

<p>If you've already got an Apps Script script, then this should be easy. What you probably want to do is implement a Calculated Model in order to get the results from BigQuery to your application. In short, a Calculated model will let you define a custom schema, and then write Apps Script code to query BigQuery and then create, fill, and return records (which will be very similar to the code you wrote to fill sheets). Once you've done this you can use the calculated model like you would a normal SQL or Drive Tables model.</p>

<p>You can read more here: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated</a></p>

<p>and using this sample (although the use case for calculated models in this sample is quite different than what you're doing): <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/calculated-model/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/calculated-model/</a></p>

<p>Just like Apps Script you'll also need to enable the Big Query Advanced Service, you can find that in the application settings screen, all the way at the bottom, (""Advanced Services"") </p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Why is there no chat request for the agent? </p>

<p>When I am using .html page to start a chat with Live agent - it works. Agent receives invite, can accept, and chat works. I tried to see what requests are sent when using .html javascript, but it appears it is using sockets - and that is beyond my debugging capabilities. </p>

<p>ALSO - if I then hijack the session key/affinity token from existing web chat with agent over to Postman - I am able to hijack session and continue sending/receiving messages from Postman. But I am not able to start a chat from Postman.</p>
","<p>I figured it out. For this call:   <code>/chat/rest/Chasitor/ChasitorInit</code></p>

<p>I needed to provide buttonId - it should have been only   
<code>""buttonId"": ""5730Y000000L2ak"".</code></p>

<p>Apparently when using html JS, it gets this value out of ""liveagent_button_online_5730Y000000L2ak"".</p>

43401120,QuickBase: Creating multiple rows in another table based on the contents of a report,"<p>Okay, so the setup here might be a little bit long, but I'll try and get to the punch line.</p>

<p>Essentially, I'm trying to enhance QuickBase in order to accommodate tracking of compensation history for employees. Approval for comp changes is done on a quarterly basis, for employees with an anniversary date that falls in that quarter. The idea is that managers would pull up a report with all relevant reviewees for that quarter, enter in their proposed comp changes, and then that would go on to the approvers for confirmation. </p>

<p>To accomplish this, we have an ""Employees"" table related to a ""Comp Records"" table, one to many. An example of a Comp Record would be Bob's Q1/2015 review, his Q1/2016 review, his Q3/2016 merit increase, and his Q1/2017 review, etc.</p>

<p>My hope is that the act of filling in proposed compensation changes is a matter of doing a grid-edit of comp records, fill in the proposed ""new salary"", and hit save. Sounds easy enough.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to create a report around ""Employees"" that shows all employees with an anniversary date in the coming quarter.
It's easy enough to create a report of all ""Comp Records"" for a given time period, for a given location, or for a given approver.</p>

<p>However, the problem is that if there are (for example) 20 people up for review in Q2, we'd need to generate 20 blank ""Comp Records"" for the appropriate dates, for those specific Employees. In other words, I don't necessarily want people to have to go in and hit ""New Comp Record"", pick an employee name, fill in the information, and hit save, 20 times.</p>

<p>I know the HTTP API has an Add Record function which I've seen other people drive via a button within QuickBase. That doesn't seem to handle it for more than one Employee at a time.</p>

<p>I've also seen that it's possible to host pages within QB and embed javascript on those pages in order to do the dirty work. That seems more likely a solution, but I'm not entirely sure how to go about using this.</p>

<p>Is there a way to use JS to query from QB ""all Employee IDs for Employees that have an anniversary date in the coming quarter"" and then loop through that list using Add Record to add Comp Records for each employee? I think an example of this is really the core of what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>In that case, I would end up with a button something to the effect of ""Start Q2 Comp Reviews"", click it one time to add the appropriate blank records, then let managers start filling in their proposed changes. That seems like a pretty reasonable experience.</p>

<p>If there's a more graceful overall solution, I'm also open to that.
Any help is much appreciated :)</p>

<li>When I reload the PowerApp, it will not show a field for ""e-mail"".</li>
</ol>

<p>Am I doing it wrong?</p>
","<p>When PowerApps generates an app from a SharePoint list or other data source, it generates the app based on the current state of the data source. If the data source changes, the app will not automatically edit itself to account for this.</p>

<p>Because of this, to update an app based on a changed data source, you will need to manually adjust it. Fortunately, this isn't difficult.</p>

<p>Below, I have an app I generated from a list called ""PowerAppList"", which had a Title column and a Column1 column. I then added Column2. As you can see, it still hasn't been adjusted.</p>

","<p>Right now, App Maker doesn't expose an API to access the model metadata.
You snippet is actually accessing App Maker's internal state and might break in future releases (the ""L"" property is actually obfuscated by a JS compiler and not designed to be accessed from user land).</p>

<p>The expression on the right of the equality sign (<code>ddAgency.Selected.Value</code>) may need to be updated, if the column that has the agency id is not called <code>Value</code>. For example, if it's called <code>Id</code>, the expression would be the one below.</p>

<pre><code>ddPersonnel.Items: Filter(Personnel, AgencyID = ddAgency.Selected.Id)

43861008,How to pass values or reference objects between the sceen powerapps,"<p>I am developing an app using PowerApps Web. Tried to integrate excel file which has tables in it. There is table called ""employee"" which has few details about employee. In first screen i just show employee listing with names in it. But when user clicks on any of the listing item, i would want to show the details about the employee in the next screen.</p>

<p>Note: I am able to connect to the excel file which is in dropbox. Excel file has employee table information. But only the problem is passing reference of selected employee to the next screen in powerapps.</p>

<p>Thanks! 
Bhat</p>
","<p>On the <a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/function-navigate/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Navigate</code> call</a> that you use to move from a screen to the next you can pass an optional third parameter (context) that is passed to the next screen.</p>

<p>So for example, if you display your employee names in a gallery in the first screen, and within one of the controls of the gallery you handle the OnSelect action to navigate to the next screen, you can pass the ThisItem value that represents the value that is being used in the gallery:</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(ScreenDetails, ScreenTransition.Fade, { employee: ThisItem })
</code></pre>

<p>In the second screen (ScreenDetails), you can access the properties of the selected employee by using the <code>employee</code> context variable. For example, if you have a text box (label) in that screen, you can set its Text property to</p>

<pre><code>employee.FullName
</code></pre>

<p>And that will show the name of the employee that you selected in the previous screen.</p>

43876357,PowerApps formula for matching records from a drop down,"<p>I'm trying to build a login form that performs a simple check against the user's PIN.  The pin in stored in the database as a field in the Person entity (table).</p>

<p>I have a Team entity that allows the Person to select the Team they are on from a dropdown list of all Teams.  The Person entity dropdown then populates based on the Person's TeamID.  The User selects their Name and enters a PIN number in the <code>txtPinNumber</code> textbox.</p>

<p><code>If(txtPinNumber.Text=Filter(Personnel,ddResponder.Selected.PIN),true,false)</code></p>

<p>However, I'm getting an error of unspecified type.  Is it because I'm trying to check the entered PIN against a filtered datatype?</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to fix this error?</p>
","<p>It looks like you're having difficulty because of your usage of the <code>Filter()</code> function. <code>Filter()</code> returns a table with all of the rows that meet a given criteria. However, it seems that <code>ddResponder.Selected.Pin</code> is the PIN you are seeking to match. If this is the case, you can simply have the visible property set to:</p>

<p><code>txtPinNumber.Text = ddResponder.Selected.Pin</code></p>

<p>If, however you need to do a search in your table to find the relevant PIN, you will instead want to use the <code>Lookup()</code> function.</p>

<p>You can see the documentation for these functions here:
<a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/function-filter-lookup/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/function-filter-lookup/</a></p>

<p>The <code>Lookup()</code> function will return the first matching row based on the criteria you provide, otherwise it will return a blank. You can use this with the <code>IsBlank()</code> function to determine whether or not to display the button.</p>

<p>The deployed or previewed app doesn't include either the definition or the <code>border-bottom-color</code> call.</p>

<p>I maintain an external CSS which we use for other websites and apps, is the best recourse to use that?</p>
","<p>Actually App Maker doesn't strip CSS variables. The cause of the problem is that App Maker prefixes <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/styles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Global Styles</a> with <code>#app</code>, what breaks your initial variables setup.</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* Design time Global CSS */

  background-color: var(--customColor);

  --customColor: red;

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* Design time Global CSS

   there is a whitespace OR new line */
 {
  --customColor: red;

/* Runtime time Global CSS */
#app {
  --customColor: red;
}

#app .app-MyPage-MyPage {
  background-color: var(--customColor);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will work but there is no guarantee that App Maker will close this door in the future (or fix the original issue).</p>

<p>I would also consider moving all variables into CSS file and adding it as external CSS resource (I'm not sure if editor will pick up it in design time).</p>

<p>Was hoping to create a local datasource with custom fields that I can ""append"" to user records from the existing Directory datasource.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>L.</p>
","<p>There is no way to create relations between Directory Model and other model types. You have at least three ways to workaround this shortage:</p>

<p><strong>One</strong></p>

<p>Query directory records on the fly - this will okish work for single-record pages, but it will be tooo slow for lists.</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong></p>

<p>You can duplicate Directory fields you need in your tables.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>it will NOT slow down your app</li>
<li>it will let you to implement queries with mixed models data (Directory + Drive Tables or Cloud SQL)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will store same data in two different places</li>
<li>Eventually your version of Directory data will become stale</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find nice sample of the second approach in
<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/templates/people-skills/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">People Skills app</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Three</strong></p>

<p>Query Directory data on demand. Let's say you have databound list, and records bound to the list have UserEmail field. In this case you can:</p>

<li>Add some button to the list row</li>

46088465,Google Appmaker: Update form based on selected dropdown option,"<p>I have an AppMaker app that has a from based off of one address table/datasource.  I can get a form with next/prev buttons, but replaced the key field (name) with a dropdown list of all names <em>(a user can start typing names to jump there, with the dropdown showing)</em>. </p>

<p>My hope is that when a user selects from the dropdown, the entire form updates and the next/prev buttons work properly as well <em>(there too many records to page thru with next/prev only)</em>.  I don't have to have next/prev functionality if it complicates things too much.</p>

<p>Currently the dropdown is working, but I cannot get the index for the next/prev buttons set or the rest of the form to reflect the selected dropdown record.</p>

<p>I've tried to set the ""onValueEdit"" event to something like this...</p>

<pre><code>var selected = widget.value;
var idx      = widget.options.indexOf(selected);

console.log(""Selected: ""+selected+"", index = ""+idx+""\n"");
if(idx &lt; 0) {                      //...this error is never hit
  console.log(""Index error - setting to zero!\n"");
  idx = 0;
}
widget.datasource.loadPage(idx);   //...update form?
</code></pre>

<p>Two observations via console logging:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The ""idx"" var is never set to the selected dropdown index reliably, and is
often ""0"" <em>(tho no error msg ever shows)</em>, so the ""indexOf()"" function 
isn't working as expected. </p></li>
<li><p>The ""selected"" var (name) is always correct.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If I call widget.datasource.loadPage(...) with a fixed value (say 5) it has no effect on what is shows in the form either <em>(previous loaded data remains)</em> - obviously not the way to do it :v/</p>

<p>Can you steer a <em>noob</em> in the right direction?</p>
","<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 
It's important that <em>Options</em> and <em>Value</em> are set as shown in the image below!</p>

I was being forced to choose <em>..projections..</em> and then a final field before the <strong>OK</strong> button would be available. </p>

<p>Not sure if AppMaker is buggy here or there is something simple I'm not understanding! </p>

<p>None of the coding in my original question is required.
Once set this way, binding just works as you would expect it!!
All other fields are set as <em>@datasource.item.</em> and are bound to whatever item is chosen.  No <em>Events</em> settings are necessary for the dropdown either, as I thought they might be.</p>

<p>Then you can simplify your life, by specifying <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/relations#ownership"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relation <strong>Owner</strong></a>. If you have it configured, then when you delete master record all related records will be deleted(cascade deletion). If you properly setup relations for all your models, then you'll need to delete records only from one model/table and all other records will be delete as well:

46275169,UserPicker changes not registered,"<p>I have to edit two objects of the same datasource. I'm using UserPicker widget to change the person attached to the objects (picking up just the email).</p>

<p>In the beginning I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>ObjectA { owner: owner1@sample.com }</li>
<li>ObjectB { owner: owner1@sample.com }</li>
</ul>

<p>After this, I want to change the owner of ObjectA to Owner2. This works out fine.</p>

<p>Then, using the same edit widget (with a different datasource item), I want to change the owner of ObjectB to Owner2, also. However, this does not work out, since the UserPicker widget does not register the change from Owner1 -> Owner2. This happens because the UserPicker has stored the value Owner2 from the first change I made (so to the app it seems that I'm making a change Owner2 -> Owner2 .. onChange not triggered, datasource not saved).</p>

<p>I've tried altering the widget value on attach, but I've yet to get it to work. Is this something that should be fixed on the AppMaker side, too?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, please ask clarifying questions if you don't understand.</p>
","<p>Ok, just in case anyone else is having this problem while the fixing of the bug is still under work (I reported the bug though). This is how I dealt with it:</p>

<p>UserPicker widget onDetach:</p>

<pre><code>if(widget.datasource.item.OwnerEmail !== widget.value) {
  widget.datasource.item.OwnerEmail = widget.value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that the value change is saved into the record anyway, when the widget is being detached.</p>

<p>However, this solution is missing the automatic validation (which is done in UserPicker widget by default). So you might need to make sure that the entered value is actually an email, in this solution there is no guarantee of that.</p>

<p>There are probably better ways to do this, but this is just a quick fix I came up with.</p>

<p>Here is the question: In one form, how can I use different datasource for different fields??? Please help. </p>
","<p>A form will save the data card value defined in <code>Update</code> into the field defined by <code>DataField</code>.  You are trying to change data displayed on the dropdown which is not set in the Fields list you have above.  Try the following (the first few steps may already be completed based on picture):</p>

<ol>
<li>Check <code>Country</code> to insert data card into form</li>
<li>Select data card and under Advanced properties click <code>Unlock to change properties</code></li>
<li>Delete text box from data card that was added by default</li>
<li>Select data card and insert desired control (drop down box)</li>
<li>Select drop down box (not data card) and under Advanced properties define <code>Items</code> and <code>Value</code> to populate values from the sharepoint list</li>
<li>Select data card and change <code>Update</code> to desired dropdown value that should be saved e.g. <code>dropDown1.Selected.country_id</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The drop down box can display the Country text on the form, but then save an associated value such as the country id.</p>

46717398,Smart search for acronyms in Salesforce,"<p>In Salesforce's Service Cloud one can enable the out of the box search function where the user enters a term and the system searches all parts of the database for a match. I would like to enable smart searching of acronyms so that if I spell an organizations name the search functionality will also search for associated acronyms in the database. For example, if I search type in American Automobile Association, I would also get results that contain both ""American Automobile Association"" and ""AAA"".</p>

<p>I imagine such a script would involve declaring that if the term being searched contains one or more spaces or periods, take the first letter of the first word and concatenate it with the letters that follow subsequent spaces or periods. </p>

<p>I have unsuccessfully tried to find scripts for this or articles on enabling this functionality in Salesforce. Any guidance would be appreciated. </p>
","<p>Interesting question! I don't think there's a straightforward answer but as it's standard search functionality, not 100% programming related - you might want to cross-post it to salesforce.stackexchange.com</p>

<p>Let's start with searchable fields list: <a href=""https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=search_fields_business_accounts.htm&amp;type=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=search_fields_business_accounts.htm&amp;type=0</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Setup there's standard functionality for Synonyms, quite easy to use. It's not a silver bullet though, applies only to certain objects like Knowledge Base (if you use it). Still - it claims to work on Cases too so if there's ""AAA"" in Case description it should still be good enough?</p></li>
<li><p>You could also check out the trick with marking a text field as indexed and/or external ID and adding there all your variations / acronyms: <a href=""https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000H6m2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000H6m2</a> This is more work, to prepare / sanitize your data upfront but it's not a bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar idea would be to use Tags although that could explode in size very quickly. It's ridiculous to create a tag for every single company.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do some really smart things in data deduplication rules.

<p>To add, I am sending a DM from salesforce to twitter, So 
1) I am setting the request body in JSON.
2) I am doing a POST.
3) I am hitting the endpoint at '<a href=""https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages/events/new.json"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://api.twitter.com/1.1/direct_messages/events/new.json</a>'

6) Creating Authorization header as twitter mentions using consumer key, Nonce, Signature, Signature method, Timestamp, Version. Building the same as in ""Guide"" section of developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/
7) On running the error code ""{""errors"":[{""code"":32,""message"":""Could not authenticate you.""}]}"".</p>

<p>Another important information that I had been using twitter old API to send DM that works perfect, only difference is it sends the request body in URL parameters instead of JSOn body but the authorization method remains same. As some new Functionality can only be achieved via Twitter New API and according to documentation the body needs to be sent via JSON format.

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I put <strong>getSubtotalTotal(@datasource.items)</strong> as the text for the label. </p>

<p>So now I just need to figure out how to tell App Maker to take that result from the script and add it to the Total field in the PORequests datasource. </p>
","<p>Okay, so here is what I did: </p>

<p><strong>1. I created two Google Drive Table models: PORequests and Items.</strong></p>

<p>PORequests has fields like: PORequest Number, Vendor and the Total*.</p>

<p>*Note: The Total field had to be a String and not a number.</p>

<p>Items has fields like: ItemName, Quantity, Cost and Subtotal.</p>

<p><strong>2. I created a ONE to MANY relationship with the two datasources (PORequests as the owner).</strong> </p>

<p><strong>3. I created a page with two Tables.</strong> </p>

<p>Table 1's datasource = PORequests
Table 2's datasource = PORequests: Items (relation)*</p>

<p>This way if I click PORequest #1 in Table 1 I only see Items associated with that POR.</p>

<p>*Note: I set the Subtotal field to ""non-editable/label"", so no one accidentally changes it manually.</p>

<p><strong>4. Then I created a Client Script:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Locale constant that is used for currency formatting.
 */
var CURRENT_LOCALE = 'en-US';


/**
 * Calculates and formats total cost of all POR items.
 * @param {Array&lt;CartItem&gt;} PORItems - list of user's POR items.
 * @return {string} formatted total cost of all POR items.
 */
function getSubtotalTotal(PORItems) {
    var cost = PORItems.reduce(function(result, item) {
    return result + item.Subtotal;
  }, 0);
  var total = cost + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Tax + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Shipping;
  return '$' + total.toLocaleString(CURRENT_LOCALE, {minimumFractionDigits: 2});
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5. Then I set the onValueEdit for the Quantity and Cost fields to:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>widget.datasource.item.Subtotal = widget.datasource.item.Quantity * widget.datasource.item.Cost;

var subtotalTotal = getSubtotalTotal(app.datasources.PORequests.relations.Items.items);
app.datasources.PORequests.item.Total = subtotalTotal;
</code></pre>

<p>This tells App Maker to first: multiply the cost by the quantity and put that value in the Subtotal field.</p>

<p>Then it tells App Maker to: use the getSubtotalTotal script to add all the Subtotal values and put THAT value in the Total field of the PORequest datasource.</p>

<p>Hope all that helps someone in the future. </p>

46882235,App Maker Grid without datasource,"<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to manually (javascript) populate/manipulate a grid in appmaker?  The situation is that a list of skills is stored in a single comma delimited string field in a table (i.e. ""MS Word, MS Excel, MS Access"") and I would like to use a grid to represent each skill in an individual cell in a grid widget and then add/delete them using the grid, similar to the Company services in the Vendor example.  Then reassemble the grid items into a single comma delimited string and save them back to the record.  </p>

<p>I can't get grid to work without a datasource. I would prefer not to put Skills in a separate table joined to the employee table. It seems like overkill.</p>

<p>Thanks for all advice!</p>
","<p>The short answer is that a grid widget requires a datasource. However, you can create a datasource parameter or a page parameter of type List and set your grid datasource equal to this parameter. Then you can use client scripts to manipulate the datasource and read or write it back to your datasource field using string to object conversions and using object to string conversions, however your field must have a string separator like a comma or similar that is used as a parser when converting between string and object. An App Maker application export file for an example is posted here: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/appmaker-users/G3UIPRRAR60"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/appmaker-users/G3UIPRRAR60</a>.</p>

46921029,Limit Dropdown Options For Datasource Relationship,"<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> </p>

<p>Need to limit the options (run a query) of a dropdown that is in a table with a relationship datasource. The field of the query exists in the OWNER datasource, while the field of the dropdown exists in the non-OWNER (child?)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Long Version:</strong></p>

<p>I have a system setup to organize PO requests. </p>

<p>Model <strong>PORequest</strong> = holds PO numbers, etc.</p>

<p>Queried Datasource <strong>PORequest_HideArchived</strong> = holds all POs, but has the query: </p>

<pre><code>Archived != :ArchivedStatus
</code></pre>

<p>Where the Archived status is set for 'Yes'. Therefore all POs with 'Yes' in the ArchivedStatus field are hidden.</p>

<p>Datasource <strong>PORequest_Items</strong> = holds the items for each PO request</p>

<p>I have setup a ONE to MANY relationship with PORequest as the owner. </p>

<hr>

<p>So now I can generate a PORequest (left) and add items to that PO via a table (middle + right) with the datasource: <strong>PORequest_HideArchived:PORequest_Items (relation)</strong>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LeNY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LeNY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So far so good. </p>

<p>That table on the far right is where I am running into a problem. I want to be able to move a PO Item from one PO to another. The easiest way to do that is change the PORequestNumber field of the item (<strong>datasource = PORequest_HideArchived</strong>) that is linked via the relationship.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDWOL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDWOL.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>All this works great too. </p>

<p>Only problem is that when I click the dropdown for the PORequestNumber I can see ALL the PORequestNumber entries, instead of JUST the POs that aren't archived.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOWJu.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOWJu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So instead of seeing 1-6, I should only be seeing the active POs (1, 5, 6)</p>

<p>The panel that the table is in has the datasource: <strong>PORequest_HideArchived:PORequest_Items (relation)</strong></p>

<p>But the Row that the PORequestNumber field is in has the datasource: <strong>PORequest_Items</strong>. </p>

<p>Therefore my query on the PORequest_HideArchived datasource has no effect. </p>

<p>Any way I can run this query so the dropdown options are limited to ArchivedStatus = 'No'?</p>
","<p>You need to set filtered datasource for the dropdown options/names:</p>

<p>I have configured the Auth0 properly but when I try to run this in Powerapps, it returns with unknown error as the response. </p>

<p>I am trying to send an image to the azure function with which I want to convert it to PDF. How can I do this? </p>
","<p>According to your code, it seems that you are using the <a href=""https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/Precompiled-functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">precompiled functions</a>. I found your HttpTrigger function code does not match the swagger file you provided. For a simple way, I just use the Azure Portal and created my HttpTrigger function as follow:</p>

<p><strong>run.csx:</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System.Net;

public static async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; Run(HttpRequestMessage request, TraceWriter log)
{
    //Check if the request contains multipart/form-data.
    if (!request.Content.IsMimeMultipartContent())
    {
        return request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.UnsupportedMediaType);
    }

    //The root path where the content of MIME multipart body parts are written to
    string root = Path.Combine(System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(""HOME""), @""site\wwwroot\HttpTriggerCSharp1\"");
    var provider = new MultipartFormDataStreamProvider(root);

    // Read the form data
    await request.Content.ReadAsMultipartAsync(provider);

    List&lt;UploadedFileInfo&gt; files = new List&lt;UploadedFileInfo&gt;();
    // This illustrates how to get the file names.
    foreach (MultipartFileData file in provider.FileData)
    {   
        var fileInfo = new FileInfo(file.Headers.ContentDisposition.FileName.Trim('""'));
        files.Add(new UploadedFileInfo()
        {
            FileName = fileInfo.Name,
            ContentType = file.Headers.ContentType.MediaType,
            FileExtension = fileInfo.Extension,
            FileURL = file.LocalFileName
        });
    }
    return request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, files, ""application/json"");
}

public class UploadedFileInfo
{
    public string FileName { get; set; }
    public string FileExtension { get; set; }
    public string FileURL { get; set; }
    public string ContentType { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The MIME multipart body parts are stored under your temp folder. You could retrieve the temp file full path via <code>file.LocalFileName</code>, then use the related library to process the conversion, then save the PDF file(s) and remove the temp file(s), then return the converted file(s) to the client.</p>

<p>Any idea, on why it's not working? </p>

<p>Edit: Here is how I tested it out on POSTMAN. I think its also related to the filename in swagger. Because when I add name/filename in the body, I get 500 internal server issue. </p>

47254010,"""Unexpected token import"" when testing Angular with Jest","<p>I've been trying to set up tests for some Angular components, but I keep running into an issue as all of my components use <code>ng-lightning</code>, which results in the following error:</p>

  <p>SyntaxError: Unexpected token import</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried multiple ways to get this going through Babel, though I'm not sure that should be required as Jest can handle it for every other file using <code>import</code> in this project.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>jest-preset-angular</code> to handle the setup for these tests. You can see the configuration it uses <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-preset-angular#exposed-configuration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've created a very small sample project where you can see this error:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/humantree/angular-lightning-test"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/humantree/angular-lightning-test</a></p>

<p>The component is as simple as this:</p>

<pre><code>@Component({
  selector: 'badge',
  template: '&lt;ngl-badge&gt;{{text}}&lt;/ngl-badge&gt;'
}) export class BadgeComponent {
  text = 'Test Badge';
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the test is as simple as this (I realize an actual test is missing, but the error still occurs before that would happen):</p>

<pre><code>describe('BadgeComponent', () =&gt; {
  let badge: BadgeComponent;

  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [BadgeComponent],
      imports: [NglModule.forRoot()]

    badge = TestBed.get(BadgeComponent).instance;
  });
});

<p>Can anyone see anything that I could add to my Jest configuration (or anything else) that would solve this error?</p>

<p>How can I get a webcontentlink of a selected image when using <code>DrivePicker</code> widget?</p>
","<p>You need to run a server function from the client to use Drive. So you can still run this function for the onDocumentSelect event, but you would want to declare a server function such as getFileWebContent() and then change your event code to:</p>

<p>Client</p>

<pre><code>var Id = widget.selectedDocId;
    google.script.run
      .withSuccessHandler(function() {
      //do something here with the returned link from server;
      })
      .withFailureHandler(function() {
      //optional failure handler;
      })
      .getFileWebContent(Id);

<p>Server</p>

<pre><code>function getFileWebContent(Id) {
  var link = Drive.Files.get(Id).WebContentLink;
  return link;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would be more ideal to run the server code in the model onCreate event which is a server function. In this case your model can have a field for the file id and in your onCreate event you would run</p>

I'm trying to do a simple join of two entities (drink and human), where the drink has a BuyerID field which relates to a ""human""'s Primary ID.
So I tried
<code>ForAll(Filter(drink, (name = ""Americano"") And (drink.BuyerID = human.PrimaryId) ), Collect(AmericanoDrinkers, {FirstName: human.firstName, LastName: human.lastName}))</code>
to get a collection of humans who brought an Americano, but I get an <code>Invalid argument type</code> error with <code>drink.BuyerID = human.PrimaryId</code>. 
Any ideas? I've tried changing <code>=</code> to <code>in</code> and stuff like <code>drink.BuyerID</code> to <code>drink[@BuyerID]</code>. Note that the drink.BuyerID datatype is ""Lookup"" and human.PrimaryId is integer, so could I be getting this error because of the different types? Also I'm certain there's nothing wrong with the data because when editting the drink entity in excel, the powerapps add-on shows the related humans when a BuyerID is selected.</p>
","<p>The problem was just the setup, I just created a new field (BuyerID2) in the drinks entity and set it as a number value rather than a lookup like BuyerID was, and all 3 (my initial one, and the two Meneghino provided) solutions worked fine (although I had to change <code>drink.BuyerID = human.PrimaryId</code> to <code>BuyerID2 in human.PrimaryId</code>). </p>

<a href=""https://web.powerapps.com/apps/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://web.powerapps.com/apps/</a><em>powerappid</em>?ID=32</p>

<p>When the app launches I want it to jump from BrowseScreen1 which lists all the Business Cases and go straight to the Business Case with the matching ID (a field from a SharePoint list).</p>

<p>I'm brand new to PowerApps but pretty sure what I need to do is called Deep Linking and I found this tutorial <a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-deep-linking/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-deep-linking/</a> and having read the comments to the article I'm trying to apply it to the OnStart property of BrowseScreen1. I don't really understand how the navigation link in the tutorial is constructed so I'm sure I'm using the wrong Navigation parameters as it always launches the first record in the list ignoring anything to do with the ID. I'm using:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If(Not(IsBlank(Param(""ID""))),Navigate(DetailScreen1,
  None,{ID:LookUp('Full Business Case For Review'.ID, ID =
  Value(Param(""ID"")))}))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>'Full Business Case For Review' is the name of the Sharepoint list and ID is a unique field that gets assigned to each list item.</p>

<p>The tutorial doesn't mention having to change anything on the detail screen but I've also wondered if I need to perhaps change the item properties there as they are currently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BrowseGallery1.Selected</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm feeling out of my depth and would really appreciate some help on this!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>John</p>
","<p>Yes, you need to change the Item property in the detail screen.  This is because there is currently no way to select an item in a gallery programmatically in PowerApps.</p>

<p>I normally get around this by using a global variable to store the current item, so you can set BrowseSreen1.OnStart to this</p>

<pre><code>If(Not(IsBlank(Param(""ID""))),
    Set(CurrentItem, LookUp('Full Business Case For Review'.ID, ID = Value(Param(""ID""))));
        Navigate(DetailScreen1, None)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>This will store the item with ID equal to your parameter as a record type variable.</p>

<p>You also need to change the OnSelect property of your BrowseGallery1's template or whichever control is used to navigate to the detail screen.  It will need to be something like this</p>

<pre><code>Set(CurrentItem, ThisItem); Navigate(DetailScreen1, None)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally set the Item property in the detail screen simply to this</p>

<pre><code>CurrentItem

<p>There are some exceptions for some widgets... For instance with widgets like Dropdown or Multiselect you can dynamically change their <code>options</code>, <code>values</code> and <code>names</code> properties, but in most cases it works only with simple types(strings/numbers) and strictly saying it is not real datasource change.</p>

<p>There is also dirty hack with <code>Dynamic</code> custom property type, but I'll not recommend to use it...</p>

<pre><code>pattern OnlyRecord :: () =&gt; (rs ~ '[s :-&gt; t]) =&gt; Sing s -&gt; Sing t -&gt; SList rs
pattern OnlyRecord ...
</code></pre>

<p>With your original pattern type signature (which is equivalent to <code>() =&gt; () =&gt; Sing s -&gt; Sing t -&gt; SList '[s :-&gt; t]</code>), you are claiming that given an expression <code>x :: SList '[s :-&gt; t]</code> you can match on this expression using your pattern synonym. However, in <code>f</code>, you don't have such an expression - you only have <code>x :: SList rs1</code> for some <code>rs1</code>, which is strictly more general. With the correct signature, you can use the pattern synonym to match on such an expression, because the pattern synonym is declared to be applicable to any <code>SList rs</code>; and then the <em>provided constraints</em> (namely <code>rs ~ '[s :-&gt; t]</code>) are available within the scope of the pattern match.</p>

<p>As this extension will be used for mobile, I have added 2 input parameters, to send the FileData as well as the FileName, to avoid having to extract that data. I have added an output parameter with the data type PendingAttachment which is the structure mentioned above.</p>

<p>So the issue I'm facing is that since it is an async method, Visual Studio isn't allowing me to have an output parameter. So is there a way to fix this?</p>

<p>P.S: Yes, I have tried implementing this normally on Service Studio, by referencing the Box File Upload plugin. It did not work (gave a 500 error). I have also been assured that this method works properly.</p>

<p>Everything works fine, till the moment we try to use any Component from it. For example, just adding the button example to one of our components:</p>

<pre><code>import Button from 'design-system-react/components/button';
&lt;Button label=""Hello World!"" onClick={this.handleClick} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we have the <code>handleClick</code> function implemented in the component</p>

<p>Something interesting is if we just import the button it works and not using it, it works.</p>

47802967,Is it possible to load AppMaker DropDowns with an Option Text and and Value?,"<p>I've been able to set the options on an AppMaker DropDown by doing this sort of thing:</p>

<pre><code>google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(function(oA){app.pages.Notes.descendants.Dropdown1.options=oA;})
    .getSelectOptions();//oA is just an array
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd like to know how to do load different values in the options and value like we can do it in javascript with something like this:</p>

<pre><code> function updateSelect(vA){
      var select = document.getElementById(""sel1"");
      select.options.length = 0; 
      for(var i=0;i&lt;vA.length;i++)
      {
        select.options[i] = new Option(vA[i].option,vA[i].value);
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I tried this by trying to get a hold of the dom element as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var elem=app.pages.myPage.descendants.myDropDown.getElement();
elem.options.length=0;//always gives me an error because options doesn't seem to exist in that object.
</code></pre>

<p>So for now I've been using the standard HTML dom elements in an AppMaker Html widget and that works okay as long as your select is on the first page.  If it's not on the first page I have found that the onChange event can't load Widgets on pages that are not visible.  It is interesting to note however that you can change the contents of HTML widgets even if they are on other non visible pages.</p>

<p>Anyway the simple question is how can one load one thing into value and another thing into option text in an AppMaker DropDown Widget?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option value=""value""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>
","<p>If you have a predefined array for your options and values you could do the following for your onAttach Event of your dropdown:</p>

<pre><code>var options = ['one thing','two thing','three thing'];
var names = ['another one thing','another two thing','another three thing'];
widget.options = options;
widget.names = names;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the values that would get recorded would be the options array, but the items that would be displayed would be from the names array. Hope this gets you on the right path.</p>

I would like to include Partner Name as a column in a table displaying SOWs. Is there a way to do this with a datasource query script? Or a different approach altogether? 
I was able to add a label to the SOW table row that is data bound to the Partner name via relation, but I have yet to tackle sorting and filtering by Partner, and this method appears to fetch Partner real-time after the table loads. I am currently using Drive Tables as my datasource, but am open to switching to Cloud SQL.</p>
","<p>You can manually add header and 'cell'(one more label in list row).</p>

<p>Binding for the label in the header:</p>

<p><code>@models.Partner.fields.Name.displayName</code></p>

<p>Binding for the label in the list row:</p>

<p><code>@datasource.item.Client.Partner.Name</code></p>

<p>And don't forget to add both <code>Client</code> and <code>Client.Partner</code> relations to <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#prefetch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prefetch</a>, it should make your page load/render faster.</p>

<p><strong>Useful tip:</strong></p>

<p>You can copy/paste existing table labels to duplicate all original margins/paddings/styles and make them look/behave in the same way as all other labels within the table. In this case you'll need just to adjust your bindings and maybe rename some things.</p>

<p>We need to set a condition on the ""Visible"" property of a button. So, first step is to make sure you are adding the following formula to the visible property.</p>

<pre><code>IsBlank(LookUp('Registered', Course_x0020_Registered_x0020_To = ThisItem.Title).Course_x0020_Registered_x0020_To)

<p>In the above code:</p>

<ul>
<li>'Registered': Name of the table I want to look into</li>
<li>Course_x0020_Registered_x0020_To: The column in the Registered Table</li>
<li>ThisItem.Title: ThisItem is provided by the BrowserGallery control. I am asking for the Title of the selected item</li>
</ul>

<p>IsBlank returns no values (blank) from the Lookup - and so the returned values will be true or false. If the Lookup is blank, it means no matches were found.</p>

<p>Realistically, I would like to set multiple filters within one role, e.g. <code>Company === ""sampleCompany"" &amp;&amp; Site === ""sampleSite""</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I currently can't see how this will function the way I need/want.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I was able to get the multiple filters to work, but only as a query script of the datasource.  The problem that created is that I already had query builder conditions within the section and you can only have query builder or query script.</p>

<p>Query Script works as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var query = app.models.Audits.newQuery();  
if(app.getActiveUserRoles().indexOf(app.roles.Test) &gt; -1)
  {   query.filters.field1._contains = ""center"";
      query.filters.field2._contains = ""status"";
      return query.run();}
else
{}

<pre><code>field1 contains? :searchText OR
field2 contains? :searchText OR
field3 contains? :searchText OR
field4 contains? :searchText OR
field5 contains? :searchText

","<p>I believe you are referring to access levels within the models themselves, such as creating, editing, loading and deleting. App Maker defaults each model so only Admins have all of those access levels. You need to go into each model and change the access levels to suit your needs. Please see the attached picture.

51351353,ARKit light estimation not working,"<p>I'm trying to implement <code>Light Estimation</code> with <code>ARKit</code>, but with no luck. What I did is run a <code>session</code> with </p>

<pre><code>configuration.isLightEstimationEnabled = true
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>arSceneView.scene                        = SCNScene()
arSceneView.autoenablesDefaultLighting   = true
arSceneView.automaticallyUpdatesLighting = true
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something else I need to do to make it work? There are no other lights in the scene, just <code>autoenablesDefaultLighting</code>. I'm using <code>iPhone 6s</code>, can it be too old to run this functionality?</p>
","<p>Depending on what you actually need to achieve the following may help.</p>

<p><code>autoEnablesDefaultLighting</code> is a Boolean value that determines whether SceneKit automatically adds lights to a scene or not.</p>

<p>By default this is set as <code>false</code> meaning that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the only light sources SceneKit uses for rendering a scene are those
  contained in the scene graph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If on the other hand, this is set to <code>true</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SceneKit automatically adds and places an omnidirectional light source
  when rendering scenes that contain no lights or only contain ambient
  lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is located from the position of the camera and pointing in the direction of the camera. </p>

<p>One issue that <a href=""https://blog.markdaws.net/arkit-by-example-part-4-realism-lighting-pbr-b9a0bedb013e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mark Daws</a> noted in his excellent article is that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The light has a changing direction, so as you walk around an object it
  will always look like the light is coming from your point of view
  (like you are holding a torch infront of you) which isn’t the case
  normally, most scenes have static lighting so your model will look
  unnatural as you move around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>isLightEstimationEnabled</code> on the other hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>provides light estimates in the lightEstimate property of each ARFrame
  it delivers.
  If you render your own overlay graphics for the AR scene, you can use
  this information in shading algorithms to help make those graphics
  match the real-world lighting conditions of the scene captured by the
  camera. The ARSCNView class automatically uses this information to
  configure SceneKit lighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means, is that if you dim the lights in your room for example, and want to apply these lighting conditions on your virtual objects to make them more realistic, this is what you want to use; since with this information we can take the lightEstimate from every frame and modify the intensity of the lights in our scene to mimic the ambient light intensity of the real world itself.</p>

<p>You can get details of lightingEstimate by setting:</p>

<p><code>configuration.isLightEstimationEnabled = true</code> </p>

<p>And then using the following callback:</p>

<pre><code>//--------------------------
// MARK: - ARSCNViewDelegate
//--------------------------

extension ViewController: ARSCNViewDelegate{

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {

        guard let lightEstimate = self.augmentedRealityView.session.currentFrame?.lightEstimate else { return }

        let ambientLightEstimate = lightEstimate.ambientIntensity

        let ambientColourTemperature = lightEstimate.ambientColorTemperature


        print(
            """"""
            Current Light Estimate = \(ambientLightEstimate)
            Current Ambient Light Colour Temperature Estimate = \(ambientColourTemperature)
            """""")


        if ambientLightEstimate &lt; 100 { print(""Lighting Is Too Dark"") }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then need to do something with the values returned and apply them to your sceneLights.</p>

<p>Putting it into practice therefore a very basic example might look like so:</p>

<pre><code>//--------------------------
// MARK: - ARSCNViewDelegate
//--------------------------

extension ViewController: ARSCNViewDelegate{

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {

        if ambientLightEstimate &lt; 100 { print(""Lighting Is Too Dark"") }

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pVAH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pVAH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It actually works really good! The only problem I'm having is that I need to stop the timer when the page is detached; that is because the record will be changed and thus the timer needs to start again. Not doing so, causes conflicts with the timer.</p>

<p>On the HTML widget onAttach event, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>//start running timer in the HTML widget
var runningTimer = new Timer();
runningTimer.start({precision: 'seconds', startValues: {seconds: startSeconds}});
runningTimer.addEventListener('secondsUpdated', function (e) {
  $('#timerDiv').html(timerRun.getTimeValues().toString());
});

//attach event listener to page onDetach event to stop timer
widget.root.getElement().addEventListener(""unload"", function(){
    runningTimer.stop();
    console.log(""Timer stopped"");
)};
</code></pre>

<p>The top part of the code is working, the bottom one does nothing. I have examined the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/logic#Events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>widget logic documentation</strong></a>, but there is no hint as to if this is possible or not. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that this might not be possible and I'm starting to freak out; Nonetheless, I wanted to consult with an expert here in case there is a solution and I just haven't found it.</p>

<p>For your valuable time and opinion on this matter, thanks in advance!</p>
","<p>So far, <strong>it is not possible to set the onDetach event handler programmatically</strong>; Nevertheless, I found a possible solution for you by implementing a custom property on the page. I used a property of type Dynamic and named it 'Timer' for this example. I did not implement Jquery library for this, but used the HTML widget options instead. Here is the html widget onAttach event code:</p>

<pre><code>//start running timer in the HTML widget
widget.root.properties.Timer = new Timer();
var runningTimer = widget.root.properties.Timer;
runningTimer.start({precision: 'seconds', startValues: {seconds: 0}});
runningTimer.addEventListener('secondsUpdated', function (e) {
  widget.html = runningTimer.getTimeValues().toString();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the page onDetach event code:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.properties.Timer.stop();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will work for you or get you going in the right direction.</p>

51352700,vlookup-like javascript to map input value from one field to another,"<p>I am just starting html/javascript, and attempting to create a simple form that populates a specific ""Customer Code"" when a ""Customer Name"" is selected from an input list (behaving like an excel vlookup). The examples I found on stackoverflow all resulted in alert windows, but I would like the value to populate in the form. </p>

<p>Here's my html snippet for the Customer Name dropdown list: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""customername""&gt;
&lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;Doe Inc&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt; Smith LLC &lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt; Rogers and Co &lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the customername to customercode mapping:
Doe Inc = 276. Smith LLC = 852. Rogers and Co = 552.</p>

<p>I would like the customercode to update to the respective customername whenever the customername is updated (without the need for a button), as this is part of a larger form that will an Submit button (in other words, I don't want users to have to click ""Submit"" to retrieve the customercode, then ""Submit"" again later in the form). </p>

<p>Thanks! </p>
","<p>In order to be included in a form submission, your form controls need to successful controls, which at the simplest means they need a <code>name=""""</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""customername"" name=""customername""&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Doe Inc&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Smith LLC &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt; Rogers and Co &lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If what you actually care about submitting is the customercode, and the customername is just the ""friendly"" version, add the <code>value</code> attribute to your options, and rename the select appropriately:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""customercode"" name=""customercode""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""""&gt;Select one...&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""276""&gt;Doe Inc&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""852""&gt;Smith LLC &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=""552""&gt;Rogers and Co &lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want both ""values"" to be visible on the form and included in the form submission, you could use a <code>data-</code> attribute to sync a readonly input:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""customername"" name=""customername""&gt;
    &lt;option data-value=""""&gt;Select one...&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option data-value=""276""&gt;Doe Inc&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option data-value=""852""&gt;Smith LLC &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option data-value=""552""&gt;Rogers and Co &lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;input type=""text"" name=""customercode"" id=""customercode"" readonly /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then use some JavaScript to sync them:</p>

<pre><code>var select = document.getElementById('customername');
select.onchange = function(e) {
  var value = select.options[select.selectedIndex].dataset.value;

  var input = document.getElementById('customercode');
  input.value = value;
}

<p>I then went on to recreate the field with the same name (StartDate) but as Date now and I get ""Duplicate column name 'StartDate'"".</p>
","<p>This is an expected behavior. If you have a field with <strong>string</strong> data type and then you want to convert that to a <strong>date</strong> data type, app maker won't do that for you. These are two different types of data. Since you've chosen to keep the data, the field was deleted from app maker's interface; however, the data is still available in google cloud sql. If you really want to keep the data, you'll have to create a new field with a different name, but if you really need the field with the same name and a different data type, you'll need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>In app maker, go to the app settings:

</ol>

<p>In summary, appmaker is not able to create the field with the same name and different data type because the field name already exists in the sql backend. The only thing you can do is to completely delete that field and get rid of the data, or restore the field and continue using strings. I hope this helps!</p>

These groups should be created in Azure Active Director.

Currently, I have a search bar <strong>(TextInput1.Text)</strong> working in conjunction with multiple ComboBoxes (<strong>ComboBox1</strong> and <strong>ComboBox3</strong>) -- which is attached to the <strong>Gallery > Items Function</strong> : </p>

<pre><code>Gallery&gt; Items = Filter('Table A', 
    ((TextInput1.Text in 'Description') || 
     (TextInput1.Text in 'Name - Long') ||
     (TextInput1.Text in 'Tags')) &amp;&amp;

     'Target Level'.Value exactin ComboBox3.SelectedItems.Result)
)

<p><strong><em>PROBLEM</em></strong></p>

<p>The issue with the <code>('Target Type'.Value exactin ComboBox1.SelectedItems.Result &amp;&amp; 'Target Level'.Value exactin ComboBox3.SelectedItems.Result)</code>, part in the function above is that when you apply the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator in between <strong>ComboBox1</strong> and <strong>ComboBox2</strong> , none of the data populates on the Gallery unless items are selected on BOTH <strong>ComboBoxes</strong>. Similarly, when using the <code>||</code> operator it only responds to the MOST RECENTLY selected items in the boxes. </p>

<p><strong><em>POSSIBLE SOLUTION</em></strong></p>

<p>In order for multiple ComboBoxes to execute cross-reference functionality(which is essentially what I'm trying to do with multiple boxes), I have to use an <strong>IF</strong> function that follows the following logic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IF(more than 1 comboBox is being selected, apply &amp;&amp; logic in between ComboBoxes[like shown above], else apply ||)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IF( just 1 combobox is being used, apply || logic, else apply &amp;&amp;)</p>

<pre><code>/**
* Gets Calendar events.
* @param {Query} query - data query with parameters.
* @return {Array&lt;Event&gt;} events from Calendar.
*/
function getEvents_(query) {
var startDate = query.parameters.StartDate;
startDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

var endDate = query.parameters.EndDate;
endDate.setDate(endDate.getDate() + 1);
endDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

if (startDate.getTime() &gt; endDate.getTime()) {
return [];
}

var results = [];
var events = 
CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar().getEvents(startDate,endDate);

events.forEach(function(item) {
var event = app.models.Events.newRecord();
event.StartDate = item.getStartTime();
event.EndDate = item.getEndTime();
event.Title = item.getTitle();
event.Color = item.getColor();
results.push(event);
});

return results;
}
</code></pre>
","<p>The function is <code>getCalendarsByName</code> with an <code>s</code> and thus it returns an array of calendars. If you know you'll only get one correct result you can just change the code to:</p>

<pre><code>CalendarApp.getCalendarsByName('email@gmail.com')[0].getEvents(startDate,endDate);
</code></pre>

<p><code>getCalendarById</code> will return a calendar on it's own, so you could just use that instead.</p>

53884162,How to Allow User Access to Published App Maker App?,"<p>I've built an app in App Maker and deployed it, but the user I thought I had given permission to is getting this notification ""Sorry, you don't have access to this application.""</p>

<p>In the app, I added a role to the data source and added the user to the role from the deployment. I also added the role to each page's security. I verified that App Maker is turned on for all of our users. I've ensured that the user has access to the Google Sheet data tables (both what I imported into the App for preview and the data I exported from the deployment). I've even added the user as a Cloud Sql Viewer in our Cloud SQL instance (don't know if that was necessary). This is my first app and I feel like I'm flying blind. I'm obviously missing something but can't figure out what. Any help is much appreciated!</p>
","<ol>
<li>Make sure <strong>all</strong> the required models can be accessed by the role you assigned to the user.</li>
<li>If the user has another Google account in the same Chrome session, the browser may be switching them to this external user when opening the app. Sign-out from that account or try incognito.</li>
<li>Make sure the deployment has no restriction as shown here; or if it does, allow the username.</li>

53916396,How do I reference a value in an App Maker query (like I do in Apps Script),"<p>I am writing a script to take a stock number, loop through existing stock numbers until a match is NOT found, then assign that unique stock number to the record. My problem is that the usual data[i][2] doesn't seem to reference a 'query' the same way that Apps Script would reference an array. </p>

<p><em>Fair warning, I'm trying to expand my Apps Script skills in to broader Javascript so I there's a good chance I'm doing it all wrong - I'm all ears if you tell me I'm doing this all incorrectly!</em></p>

<p>Using the log: data[i][2] gives me 'undefined' whereas data[2] gives me all fields of the third item in my query. Based on this I feel like I just need to learn how to reference it properly.</p>

<pre><code>//Querying my datasource as 'var data'
var query = app.models.UsedVehicles.newQuery();
query.filters.ParentDealType._contains = prefix;
var data = query.run();
//Returns four records which is correct.

var testStockNo = prefix+month+countstring+year; 
console.log(""Test Stock Number "" + j + "": "" + testStockNo);
for (i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++){
     console.log(""data[i][2]: "" + data[i][2]); //results: undefined

        k++;
        break;
     }else{

No Match</p>
","<h3>Issue/Solution:</h3>

<p><code>query.run()</code> returns array of records and NOT a array of arrays(2D). You should access the <code>Record</code> value using it's <code>key</code> instead of a <code>index</code>.    </p>

<pre><code>console.log(""data[i][TStockNo]: "" + data[i]['TStockNo']);

54060686,Can ZOHO deluge script getUrl() function read HTTP response headers?,"<p>When trying to use getUrl() to grab a CSV file from a URL with basic .htaccess authorisation, I am redirected to an AMAZON S3 location. The getURL() function passes the original HTTP headers (for the auth) to Amazon S3 which Amazon thinks is an Amazon token; this causes the following error in the response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only one auth mechanism allowed; only the X-Amz-Algorithm query parameter, Signature query string parameter or the Authorization header should be specified</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't see this issues talked about anywhere other than an advisory from Thompson Reuters: <a href=""https://community.developers.thomsonreuters.com/questions/29247/aws-download-x-direct-download-returns-invalid-arg.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://community.developers.thomsonreuters.com/questions/29247/aws-download-x-direct-download-returns-invalid-arg.html</a></p>

<p>The fix is to receive the redirect back from the remote server, look at the response and pull out the new (redirected) URL and grab the CSV file from there without the auth details in the header.</p>

<p>Is there a way in deluge script ZOHO to do this? The getUrl() function seems really basic and the documentation is very thin.</p>

<p>The other way to do this is a 'middleware' application that can use CURL, save the CSV's on a remote server then use ZOHO getUrl() to pull these CSV files. This is not an optimal solution but unless ZOHO gives access to some HTTP client functions then I don't see another way.</p>

54066925,Patch Function: Insert New Record with Lookup Column not working,"<p>I've read that the Patch function allows one to insert a new record while also updating the values of Lookup Columns in that same record. I am however having some trouble with what I think is the Defaults section of the Patch function, as well as using dropdowns from a different datasource.</p>

<p>I have a ""New Inspection"" screen, called ""EditScreen_New"" which collects a lot of values from the user and writes a new record into my ""Merchandiser Inspection"" Sharepoint list. Apart from the basic fields of Inspector Name, Inspection Date etc, there are 2 fields, Partnership and Store, which are Dropdowns with options from another list with the datasource name of ""Store_2"".</p>

<p>The 2 fields are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Partnership</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropdown control from the ""Store_2""</li>
</ul>

<p>Distinct(SortByColumns(Store_2.Partnership0, ""Partnership0""), Partnership0)</p></li>
<li><p>Store</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Combobox control from the ""Store_2"" datasource, cascaded on the Partnership value selected above</p></li>
<li><p>I've used Combobox instead of Dropdown, so that the field is searchable (it's a long list)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>SortByColumns(
    Filter(Store_2, Partnership0 = Dropdown_Partnership.Selected.Value),
    ""Store"")</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To save a new record I used to have the standard ""SubmitForm"" on the OnSelect attribute of my Save button, however I now know that this won't update/save the values to the Lookup Columns of Partnership and Store - it just left these 2 fields empty.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the ""Defaults"" section sufficient to grab the values from all the other fields and insert them into the new record? I.e. Does PowerApps know to use all the values entered on the screen and insert them as the values for my new record? </p></li>
<li><p>In the ""Id"" attribute for the Partnership field, how does PowerApps know what the Id of the new record is, as the record hasn't been inserted yet. Do I even need the Id attribute?</p></li>
<li><p>Because my Dropdown_Partnership uses the ""Store_2"" datasource, but the EditScreen_New is trying to insert a record into the ""Merchandiser Inspection"" datasource, is this causing my above error message about the invalid argument type?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I be using the ""Collect"" function instead, or in addition?</p></li>

But the thing is the stage loaded to slow and the loading bar is close even before all the stage finish loading. I believe it has to be with the <code>app.closeDialog()</code>. So I try to put it inside some condition to check if the <code>Label1</code> has finish loaded or not:</p>

<pre><code>requestDs.relations.WorkflowStages.createItem(function() {
var createDatasource = requestDs.relations.WorkflowStages.relations.Approvers.modes.create;
var draft = createDatasource.item;
draft.Email = 'xxx@airasia.com';
draft.Name = 'xxxx xxxx';          

createDatasource.createItem(function(createdRecord) { }); 

  if (requestDetailsPage.descendants.StagesList.descendants.StagesListRow.descendants.DraftStagePanel.descendants.Grid1.children.Grid1Cell.descendants.Label1.loaded) {
   app.closeDialog();    
   }     
 });
}

<p>So if <code>Label1</code> had finished loading only then it will close the loading bar. Anyway I don't think I have reference it correctly to the <code>Label1</code> and got error like </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>descendent is not defined</p>

<ul>
<li>The URL generated in the email is correct, and exactly matches the URL you'd be at if you navigated to the same page/record from within the app.</li>
<li>It looks like there's some kind of link resolution going on when you click on the email link -- there's a brief period when the URL in the address bar is of the form <code>https://www.google.com/url?q=https://script.google.com/a/xxxxx/macros/s/&lt;correct script ID&gt;/exec?evalId%3D823%23EditEvaluation&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=&lt;number&gt;&amp;usg=&lt;string&gt;</code></li>

</ul>

<p>Here's what I've checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the deployment settings, the app runs under the user's account, and application access is not restricted.</li>

  var ownerEmail = app.pages.Main.descendants.TextBox1.value;

54223484,I show the grades to each of my students using Google sheets and publishing them with the scripts editor. Can I do the same with Google app maker?,"<p>Google announced that Apps Script UI service will be discontinued next July. At my school some teachers are using Google sheets gradebooks together with app scripts code to publish the grades as a webpage, so that each student can see only his/her grades. If next school year this is not going to work any more, we need to find a new way of doing the same. Google suggests using Google App maker. </p>

<p>Since I am a teacher and not a developer, I have no idea of how to use the App maker. I am ready to learn, though, if it is the best way to solve the problem. </p>

<p>But before I use a lot of the time I don't really have in learning to use a new tool, I would really appreciate if you could tell me that what we are doing with Apps Script can be done using the Google App maker.</p>

<p>I would be really grateful if you could show me the way to start migrating the script code to App maker.</p>

54363950,PowerApp not mapping values into Azure DevOps integration correctly,"<p>I created a Microsoft Powerapp application which has three fields: name, companyororganization and score. These values should be sent to Azure Devops, so I created Azure DevOps integration in PowerApps (there is ready build integration for that).</p>

<p>Name is mapped into title, score is mapped into Createworkitem_Userenteredfields and company is mapped into Createworkitem_userenterfields_1.</p>

<p>In Powerapps i'm calling the service with code:
PowerAppsbutton.Run({Score: 100}, ""Example name"", {Companyororganization: ""abc""}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {})</p>

<p><em>Empty fields are there because I have created 6 dynamic contents into flow and don't know how to delete extra ones...</em></p>

<p>I'd like to get a list of the emails from entires that the user checks. At this point I'm not even able to access the status of a single checkbox. This is the current code snippet I tried adding to a button:</p>

<p><code>console.log(widget.parent.parent.parent.children.Panel1.children.Table3Panel.children.Table3.children.Table3Body.children.Table3Row.children.UserSelectionCheckbox.value);</code></p>

<p>I get the error:</p>

<p><code>Cannot read property 'children' of undefined
at Home.Panel1.OuSelectPanel1.Button6.onClick:1:133</code></p>

<p>I was able to use the autofill to write this entire statement, why can't it find the child object? Is there any way to reference this list directly without going down the tree from the widget or the app root? </p>
","<p>For this type of functionality the autofill (intellisense) will not work for you. You need to address the children differently when you try to get a collection of rows from a table. I would suggest code similar to this for your button onClick event:</p>

<pre><code>var rows = widget.root.descendants.Table3Body.children._values;
var emails = [];
for (var i in rows) {
  var value = rows[i].children.Checkbox1.value;  
  if (value) {
    emails.push(rows[i].datasource.item.Email);
  }
}
console.log(emails);
</code></pre>

<p>Again the auto complete code feature simply won't work after you choose the _values, which will return all immediate children of your table body, which is what you want.</p>

54392707,How can I load the datasource for a relation in a table?,"<p>I have 2 models: Applicants and Submissions. They have a 1&lt;->many relationship. When I load a detail page for a single applicant, I have a table with some details of every Submission that they've submitted. I want to change the onClick event for each row so that it navigates to a page with details of that submission. The submission detail page has ""Submissions"" as its datasource.</p>

<p>It seems that while the relation is correctly loaded on the Applicant detail page, the app.datasources.Submissions datasource is not loaded so that app.datasources.Submissions.selectKey doesn't work. </p>

<p>I get confused about when this onClick trick works and when it doesn't. It definitely works if you make a page for, say, all Submissions and use a table to display some of their detail. If you set onClick to a row to navigate to a Submission detail page, the correct data is loaded into that other page. Note that for this simple example, you don't have to do a trick like app.datasources.Submissions.selectKey(widget.datasource.item._key), rather, it just works.</p>

<p>This situation is different, however, in that the table is full of details from a relation. Again, the Applicant detail page does correctly load the details of the relation. What kind of works is to set the datasource of the Submission detail page to app.datasources.Applicants.item.Submissions. I say ""kind of"" because it only loads the first item and I don't know how to use the ""selectKey"" trick above for this workaround.</p>

<p>What does work is this:
onDataLoad of table: make a query for the Submissions datasource to grab every item that's in the widget(the table) datasource</p>

<p>onClick of row: app.datasources.Submissions.selectKey(widget.datasource.item._key)
app.showpage(app.pages.View_Submission);</p>

<p>Submissions detail page: set datasource to just plain old ""Submissions""</p>

<p>This does actually work well, but I'm frustrated that it seems I'm loading the Submissions data twice: once when the relation is loaded and once when I do this trick.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Search page sample:</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D47Zw.png"" alt=""Advanced Search page sample""></p>

<p>I tried to bind the Column's name dropdown to <code>@datasource.query.parameters.Parameter</code> and changed the Query part of the datasource like this:</p>

<p><strong>Datasource's Query Script and Parameters:</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CoWMa.png"" alt=""Datasource&#39;s Query Script and Parameters""></p>

<p>However, I keep getting errors like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parameter 'Column' is used in 'where' clause but not defined in property 'parameters'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could you please tell me how can I resolve this problem? </p>
","<p>You literally have to construct your 'Where' clause in this case and then set the parameter of the where clause equal to your parameters. So lets say your first set of parameters is Column1: Name, Query1: contains, Parameter1: John, then your datasource needs to have the following parameters Column1, Query1, and Parameter1 and your bindings on your dropdown1, dropdown2, and textbox1 should be:</p>

<pre><code>@datasource.query.parameters.Column1
@datasource.query.parameters.Query1
@datasource.query.parameters.Parameter1
</code></pre>

<p>respectively.</p>

<p>Then your query script needs to be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if (query.parameters.Field1 === null || query.parameters.Query1 === null) {
  throw new app.ManagedError('Cannot complete query without Parameters!');
}

switch (app.metadata.models.MaintenanceManagement.fields[query.parameters.Field1].type) {
  case 'Number':
    query.parameters.Parameter1 = Number(query.parameters.Parameter1);
    break;
  case 'Date':
    query.parameters.Parameter1 = new Date(query.parameters.Parameter1);
    break;
  case 'Boolean':
    if (query.parameters.Parameter1 === 'True' || query.parameters.Parameter1 === 'true') {
      query.parameters.Parameter1 = true;
    } else {
      query.parameters.Parameter1 = false;
    }
    break;
  default:
    query.parameters.Parameter1 = query.parameters.Parameter1;
}
query.where = query.parameters.Column1 + "" "" + query.parameters.Query1 + ""? :Parameter1"";
    return query.run();
</code></pre>

<p>So your where statement essentially becomes a string that reads 'Name contains? :Parameter1'  (i.e. John) that then becomes your query. Hope this makes sense, feel free to ask follow up questions.</p>

54446152,How To Download a generated CSV file from App Maker?,"<p>I've created a AppMaker App for our internal users to facilitate an approval process.
The Master approver has asked for the option to download a CSV file with a bunch of data without saving it to GDrive. (I also didn't want to go with this approach since that would require the Drive permission and the users freak out when they see that the app is requesting for the permission to access their files).</p>

<p>So, the furthest I got was to use window.open() with the csv data which does download a csv file but without any extension. However, that's not elegant and it makes it more difficult for the person using it to have to rename it to download.csv or to open it from Excel instead of double-clicking it.</p>

<p>I found online the option of using an anchor with href and the download attribute and happily implemented it only to get the nice error from AppMaker that <strong>Anchor href is not allowed to start with ""data:""</strong>.</p>

54462153,Salesforce integration - categorisation based on pricing plans,"<p>I am stuck as a developer trying to explore Salesforce for integrating with my CRM which is used by our clients as SaaS. </p>

<p><strong>Background of what i want to achieve in the integration</strong></p>

<p>The idea is that my CRM software allows many features that Salesforce does not and vice-versa. Due to this a typical client who is using my CRM (Saas) ends up using both the softwares. This ends into duplication of efforts where for eg: a customer created in my CRM has to be copied over to Salesforce manually from Salesforce UI. </p>

<p>The integration that i wish to provide will work like a 2 way integration where a customer created from my CRM gets created as Accounts in Salesforce and vice-versa. Same way sync of edits and deletes across the 2 system should work. </p>

<p><strong>Problem that i am having</strong></p>

<p>When i started exploring Salesforce integration, i found that Salesforce allows integration to be done in below ways</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Apex trigger based system</strong> - I was able to achieve 2 way syncing with Salesforce and my CRM using Apex approach. But the problem is it requires me to access their web api's to send data from my CRM to Salesforce. This feature is only supported in higher pricing plans of Salesforce (Enterprise, Unlimited, Professional - you have to pay extra if you are using professional)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>App based approach (eg: Slack)</strong>: I am looking more towards this approach. As Slack integration works for almost all pricing plans and is supported well. What i could not conclude clearly is - how can i create an App for my CRM and get it listed on Salesforce? How does Salesforce allow an App based access from Slack to submit data into Salesforce system for lower pricing plans. Their documentation says that Api access is only available for higher pricing plans. Then how is this achieved? For eg: you can install Salesforce app into Slack and there after you can send messages to chatter service under individual accounts of Salesforce from Slack. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am really not sure if i have given enough insight into the problem i am having. But i tried explaining as much as possible. In short i want to integrate 2 way with Salesforce and i am looking for possible solution that is supported at lower pricing plans as well. What type of integration should i go forward with?</p>

<p>How can I achieve the desired outcome? Is adding eventlisteners possible in this fashion through app maker? </p>
","<p>You can definitely do so and you got it almost right. The only thing you need to understand is that the appmaker widget is not a native html element hence the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cijCell.addEventListener is not a function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, AppMaker has a way of getting the native html elements associated to a widget. You need to use the <code>getElement()</code> method and then you can use the add/remove event listeners methods. So you should change your code from <code>cijCell.addEventListener...</code> to <code>cijCell.getElement().addEventListener...</code></p>

54477736,Salesforce - Best way to delete multiple records from an Object hierarchy and error handling in Salesforce,"<p><strong>Context:</strong> 
We would like to delete multiple records in the Case and its related/child objects. The child objects have few related objects. There are 4 to 5 levels of hierarchy as follows</p>

<ul>
<li>Case</li>
<li>--Task</li>
<li>-----Child1</li>
<li>--------Child2</li>
<li><p>-----------Child3</p>

<p> 
The related objects are having master-child relationship with cascade delete set to false.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Currently the way we are deleting cases in a batch is as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect all cases in the batch</li>
<li>Collect all the tasks for all cases in the batch</li>
<li>Collect all the Child1 records for all Cases in the batch</li>
<li>Collect all the Child2 records for all Cases in the batch</li>
<li>Collect all the Child3 records for all Cases in the batch</li>
</ol>

<p>Then delete each set of records in batch using bulk delete. The advantage is we will have only 5 deletes per batch and we don't hit governor limits.</p>

<p>However the down side of this process is, when there is error in deleting in any of the steps above, whole transaction is rolled back.  Though we can get which delete caused he error, we cannot role back objects related to only that particular case.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is there are any better way to handle deleting of records and child
records.  </li>
<li>Is there a way to rollback only the cases and the child
records which had error</li>
</ol>
","<p>Use bottoms up approach along with batch.</p>

<p>For example start with Child3. collect all the records that needs to be purged in each related object and case object. Then delete in batch. </p>

<ul>
<li>Child3</li>
<li>--Child2</li>
<li>-----Child1</li>
<li>--------Task</li>
<li>-----------Case</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Declarative method:</strong>
Use the Process Event and Process Builder/flow field count in each object is less than 350. The advantage of this method is you don't have to write code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using Apex class:</strong>
Write apex code to get all the related objects that needs to be purged/deleted and execute in batch. </p>

<p>a) Set the batch size of 1 so that any error while deleting, only the related records will be rolled back. </p>

<p>b) If batch size is set to higher than 1, whole batch will be rolled back. In this case   you need to identify the parent (Case object) id and mark them for error and re-read all the other records which were rolled back as part of the batch and run again. In this method, identifying the failed record (if the records failed in child3) and its root parent (case) id could be challenging.</p></li>

54521407,Can a user who isn't admin use Teamdrives.list(),"<p>I've been trying to use the advanced Drive service in Google App Maker.  Specifically using the 'q' parameter within the option arguments to the Drive.Teamdrives.list() method.</p>

<p>After many many hours of trying to formulate a query that enabled me to filter on the name, I discovered that I have to set useDomainAdminAccess=true for the query to work.  Without that switch I get an error from the query.</p>

<p>My App Maker application is going to run as User instead of Developer and the intended application will query what Teamdrives the user has access to that have a pling(!) in the name.</p>

<p>Can domain users use the useDomainAdminAccess switch or is that only domain admins?  Does useDomainAdminAccess give access to all teamdrives in the domain or only teamdrives that the user has access to?</p>

<p>Why is this switch necessary for the q parameter to work?</p>

<p>Should I abandon this way of doing things and research another?</p>

<pre><code>function myFunction() {
list = Drive.Teamdrives.list({q:""name contains '!'"",
                            maxResults:4,
                            useDomainAdminAccess:true});
Logger.log(list);
}
</code></pre>
","<p>I should have just used the javascript filter() function to filter my array after the team drives have been scanned.</p>

<pre><code>  list = Drive.Teamdrives.list({maxResults:100}).items;

  filtered = list.filter(function(obj){
    return obj.name.indexOf('Key') === 0;}
                       );
</code></pre>

<p>The code reads only the teamdrives that the user has access to and therefore does not need the useDomainAdminAccess flag.</p>

<p>The array filter returns a new array of only those teamdrives that begin with the word 'Key'.</p>

<p>I'm following <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-gateway-onprem#ports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> support article from Microsoft to get it set up.</p>

<p>Everything I've done so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SQL Server Express instance is setup on a normal Windows 10 Pro machine we have within our domain.</li>
<li>I've created a service account on the domain to access SQL Server, and added the db_owner role for it on the database we're trying to access. </li>
<li>I've configured SQL Server to allow external connections with a non-standard port (49172), and tested this using another machine within the domain to connect using the service account, which works great.</li>
<li>I installed the On-Premise Data Gateway from Microsoft and configured it using my work Microsoft account. That works fine as well, and I can see the gateway in PowerApps listed as Live. HTTPS is enabled (recommended on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51885130/connecting-sql-server-on-prem-to-powerapps"">this question</a>)</li>
<li>I've added explicit rules allowing all the ports and whitelisted all the IPs suggested by MS in the support article I followed (link above).</li>
</ul>

<p>The weird thing is if I change the username/password to something incorrect, it gives me an ""invalid credentials"" error, so I know it can at least hit the domain/SQL Server to authenticate. Is there a setting I'm missing somewhere in SQL Server?</p>
","<p>So, I'm an idiot and had the SQL Server name wrong. In the tutorial I watched the instructor just listed the computer name (which is what I was doing), but I needed to add a backslash and SQLEXPRESS as well.</p>

","<p>I recommend you to use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/reference/url"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google.script.url</a> api.

      ds.selectKey(rId);

","<p>@Rishabh Kushwaha You have missed to set  User agent Header in the Rest API. </p>

<p>As Per <a href=""http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/specs/rfc7231.html#header.user-agent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7231</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A user agent SHOULD send a User-Agent field in each request unless
  specifically configured not to do so.</p>

<p>You could use a simple user agent header like User-Agent:  “PHP 5.7.1”. Try with proper user agent header and rest api will work as expected. This should be useful to monitor the source of request originates and also make it easy to find your tests in the access stats log. </p>

<p>So on the line <code>return $this-&gt;SendDataToZoho($apiUrl,$postData);</code> I am expecting a xml reponse that could then be parsed to see weather the data has been successfully inserted into zoho or not.

We are migrating an Aura component to LWC. We have a USE CASE,  is being used in an iteration. 
On click of , we are showing . The data in  is dynamically retrieved based on record-id of . 
In Aura, this was fairly simple because when  fires an event, we can inject the data through method from grand parent to event.getSource().

54800171,Circumventing query page size limitations,"<p>In the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/templates/project-tracker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project Tracker template</a> there is a feature where statistics for a certain project's items are displayed. You can filter the project items, but the statistics will only show those statistics for all the project items, i.e. the filters do not affect the statistics.</p>

<p>I would like to add the feature of filters affecting those statistics in a similar implementation of mine. My current solution passes the keys of those project items (affected by filters, too) to a calculated data source, which then calculates the statistics using those item keys, essentially applying the filters used in the page.</p>

<p>My issue is that my calculations are restricted by the query page size. For example, if I apply filters that limit the number of items to 15 records, but the page size is 10 records, I will only have statistics of those first 10 items, which is not useful. I'd need to have the statistics on all the records that are left after filtering.</p>

<p>One way to solve this would be to get rid of the query page size and leave it at 0. However, similarly to the Project Tracker template, I'm displaying the project items on the page in a table, and if I do that, the page becomes too heavy.</p>

<p>How can I circumvent the query page size? I'm thinking I could</p>

<ul>
<li>limit the items displayed in the page by some other way than query page size (i.e. hiding items from the UI)</li>
<li>use a different datasource for the statistics, but in some way copying the filters used in the datasource that is displaying the project items</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these ways I could think of, I can't seem to implement. I don't know how I could hide items from the UI to make it less heavy, as query page size pretty much does it. I have also tried copying the filters from a datasource to a similar one, but that does not seem to work.</p>

<p>EDIT: I might have come up with a way to solve this myself, but I still need to implement it. Now I'm using the page size restricted Items Ds to apply the filters on, and the statistics are build from this data source. If instead, I use a non-restricted Ds called AllItems, and apply the filters on it, and then pass the item keys to a page size restricted Ds (to show the items in UI) AND to a calculated Ds (for the stats). Will make a response once I've verified it works.</p>
","<p>I solved the issue myself.</p>

<p>To produce (refreshable) statistics subject to filtering but not restricted by page size, I used the following datasource structure:</p>

<p>In this structure, the filters practically flow to the data sources below, as they are passed the ItemKeys that fit the filter. What this completes is that my Statistics (used in piegraphs etc.) can be filtered dynamically and account for all the records that fit the filter, while the UI does not get crowded over too many records, as the data source used in UI has a query page size limitation.</p>

","<p>Based on your comment:</p>

<p>You got almost everything right with a couple of exceptions. So your getTimeStamp function should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getTimeStamp(){
    var timestamp = + new Date();
    return timestamp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, because you have to return a value. The other problem is that when you are assigning the value to the datasource item, you don't have to use the keyword <code>new</code>; therefore, it should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>var timestamp = getTimeStamp();
widget.datasource.item.Timestamp_IN = timestamp;
</code></pre>

Is there a way to secure specific fields of a relation based on user roles?</p>
","<p>Using calculated model (based on a server side script) is the best option here. That way, only the data that you need to show will be fetched. So in your case, as an example we can use a calculated model called <strong>EmployeeInfo</strong> with the fields <strong>name</strong> and <strong>salary</strong>. The Server Script of that datasource can contain something like this:</p>

<pre><code>return getEmployeeInfo();
</code></pre>

<p>Then on your server script you can have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getEmployeeInfo(){
  var userRoles = app.getActiveUserRoles(); 
  var query = app.models.Employees.newQuery();
  var allEmployees = query.run();

  var allRecs = [];
  for(var i=0; i&lt;allEmployees.length; i++){
    var empInfo = app.models.EmployeeInfo.newRecord();
    var employee = allEmployees[i];
    empInfo.name = employee.name;
    if(userRoles.indexOf(""Admins"") &gt; -1){
      empInfo.salary = employee.salary;
    }

54910488,SQL date discrepancy with some dates,"<p>I am working on a date problem.</p>

<p>So, in the app I have a table that have some user records that includes a date of birth field (datetime sql type). The problem is that for some users whose date of birth is prior to 1954, the date is not properly reflected. </p>

<p>For example, I have a user whose date of birth is <strong>11/08/1920</strong> but when I set the date of birth via server script, it ends up with the value <strong>11/07/1920 23:23:24</strong>.</p>

<p>I am getting the date value from a spreadsheet and the server script looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>function importDOBs(){

  var allRecs = [];

  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(""adfsasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf"");
  var sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();

  var data = sheet.getRange(2,4,sheet.getLastRow(),2).getValues();
  for(var i=0; i&lt;5; i++){
    var row = data[i];
    var date = row[0];
    var oldMrn = row[1];

    var query = app.models.purgedRecords.newQuery();
    query.filters.oldMrn._equals = oldMrn;
    var record = query.run()[0];
    if(record){
      var dob = new Date(date);
      record.dateOfBirth = dob;
      allRecs.push(record);
    }
  }

  app.saveRecords(allRecs);

}
</code></pre>

<p>These are the values in the spreadsheet (they are strings, not dates):</p>

<pre><code>1954-03-04T00:00:00
2014-03-01T00:00:00
1951-10-20T00:00:00
1920-11-08T00:00:00
1938-09-27T00:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>However, somehow I'm always getting this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0tIy6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0tIy6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you see, there is a discrepancy on the dates that are prior to 1954. So far, I have tried other things such as changing this part:</p>

<pre><code>if(record){
  var dob = new Date(date);
  record.dateOfBirth = dob;
  allRecs.push(record);
}
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(record){
  var dob = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(date),""GMT"",""yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"");
  var birthDate = new Date(dob);
  record.dateOfBirth = birthDate;
  allRecs.push(record);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the above resulted in the same thing. I have tried other dates after 1954 and they also seem wrong. For example <strong>05/19/1968</strong> reflects <strong>05/18/1968 23:00:00</strong>. So my best guess so far this has to do something with the daylight savings, perhaps?</p>

","<p>If I understand correctly, you could create another VNET, add APIM into that VNET using internal mode (this will block access to APIM from outside of VNET), and setup peering between APIM's VNET and ASE's VNET.

54935102,PowerApps Data Source Changed to Stored Procedure,"<p>The data source in PowerApps gallery was a SQL View.</p>

<pre><code>Search('[dbo].[vwCandidate]', textSearchCandidate.Text, ""NameLast"", ""NameFirst"", ""MiscellaneousTags"", ""EmailAddress"", ""PhoneNumber"")
</code></pre>

<p>The selected record populated a global variable for the form item.</p>

<pre><code>Set(varCandidate, gallerySearchResults.Selected)
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works as expected.  Then, I changed the data source to use a stored procedure to move the search from PowerApps to SQL server. After doing so I received the error message </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Incompatible Type. We can't evaluate your formula because the context
  variable types are incompatible with the types of the values in other
  places in your app""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot revert back to the view that was working without getting the same error. I'm hoping my only option is NOT to use a new variable and change every occurrence in the form/App. I'd like to avoid this if possible.</p>

<p>I cannot view the form so I'm not sure how to debug properly. My hunch is the date fields being returned via Flow are causing the problem. They are 'smalldatetime' types and the Flow is returning a string '<code>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.000</code>' even though 'date' is being requested.</p>

<pre><code>""PhoneNumber"": {
  ""type"": ""string""
},
""CandidateStatus"": {
  ""type"": ""string""
},
""DateApplied"": {
  ""type"": ""string"",
  ""format"": ""date""
},
</code></pre>

<p>Flow JSON here does not seem to like any of the other 'date' format types.</p>

<p>Are there any workarounds from Flow?  Should I reformat the date values when I am setting the global variable?  Advice?</p>
","<p>Turns out, I was on the right track thinking that the DATE data type coming from Flow as a string.  Here's why:</p>

<p>A new record was created using a Patch function while setting the global variable:</p>

<pre><code>Set(varCandidate, Patch('[dbo].[candidate]', Defaults('[dbo].[candidate]'), {DateApplied: DateTimeValue(Text(Now())), CreatedDate:DateTimeValue(Text(Now())), CreatedBy:varUser.Email}))
</code></pre>

<p>The ""DateApplied"" field was a ""DATE"" type in the SQL table and it was coming from Flow as a string ""2019-03-13T17:40:52.000"".  The recordset from Flow was being set to the same global variable when I wanted to edit the record</p>

<pre><code>Set(varCandidate, gallerySearchResults.Selected)
</code></pre>

<p>The error ""Incompatible Type"" (see question for full error message) was due to this field being a ""Date Value"" in a new record and a ""string"" in an edit record.</p>

<p>My fix is to remove this ""Date"" type fields from the patch and modify the Flow to retrieve the newly created record record by ID.</p>

54987992,Google App Maker - autofill textbox depending on dropdown selected option from an external database,"<p>What I'm currently doing is that on the Property Editor of my dropdown widget, on the Event Section using the <code>onValueEdit</code> function,  I'm trying to create a custom action script which will give a value to my textbox (using <strong>widget.root.descendants.NameOfMyTextbox.value</strong>) depending on the selected value of my dropdown.</p>

<p>The values of my dropdown are the IDs stored in my MySql database table <strong>Process</strong>, for example: <code>ID = 1, name = Assembly, manager = George</code>. For the textbox, I would like to get another table field value depending on the selected value of my dropdown through a <strong>select</strong> statement (like getting the manager value). What kind of app maker queries or functions should be useful in this case? </p>
","<p>If your dropdown option binding is <code>@datasources.Process.items</code> then your <code>onValueEdit</code> event simply needs to be:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.descendants.NameOfMyTextbox.value = newValue.manager;
</code></pre>

<p>This would be the only way to set this up however, because this way the options are pointing to your entire record in the Process table and upon selection you can get any other field from that record using <code>newValue.YourField</code>.</p>

The database has 15 tables in total. </p>
","<p>You need to create model per table.</p>

<p>You can connect your existing database to App Maker (in application settings) and import tables as models (create model -> existing model). So you don't need to re-create fields.</p>

  <p>The accordion is a ListPanel with a detailed view that expands below the selected row. This detailed view is edited as a prototype, like the main row view. During runtime, one row is shown per item in the accordion's datasource. The datasource for that row is a special single item datasource pointing to the corresponding item in the Accordion's datasource. The detail row is also given this special datasource. This allows the prototype row to access the current row's item with the '@datasource.item' syntax.</p>

  var query = app.models.Employees.newQuery();
  var results = query.run();

  var fields = app.metadata.models.Employees.fields;

  var data = [];

  var header = [];

  for (var i in fields) {
    header.push(fields[i].displayName);
  }

  data.push(header);

  for (var j in results) {
    var rows = [];
    for (var k in fields) {
      rows.push(results[j][fields[k].name]);
    }
    data.push(rows);
  }

  if (data.length &gt; 1) {
    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.create('Employee Export');
    var sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();
    sheet.getRange(1,1,data.length,header.length).setValues(data);

    //here you could return the URL for your spreadsheet back to your client by setting up a successhandler and failure handler
    return ss.getUrl();

55043215,Show records per user in table widget in App Maker,"<p>I'm almost finished with my first App Maker app (learned a lot, thanks for the help so far!). The app currently collects timestamp data when users log in and out of the work site. As the time between leaving and returning could be a few hours, and because App Maker is browser based, I originally had issues where the user was unable to complete the record and tap the Time_IN button. I solved this by moving the <em>Time IN</em> Button to a pop-up attached to the records page, so when the user came back to work they could open the record, tap <em>Time IN</em> and be on their way. Simple, right?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iyWUm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iyWUm.jpg"" alt=""New Time IN method""></a></p>

<p>My trouble now is that users were unable to see their own records on the <em>UserRecords</em> page, unless I made them admins, but then it grants access to the full table on not just their own, showing all records for all users. The navigation menu originally had this snippet of code which I removed:</p>

<pre><code>(@user.roles).indexOf('Admins', 'Managers') !== -1
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm not sure if I've missed something as the issue still seems to be partly user role based? Here is an image of the datasource fields, there are only two models in this app, GatePass (as shown in the picture) &amp; Directory (for user picker).</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the user should only see their records in the <em>UserRecords</em> page so they can access and complete their submission. The same is doubly true for their exports. Can anyone please help?</p>
","<p>In your model, go to the <strong>DATASOURCES</strong> tab. If you have more than one datasource showing up, then it's up to you to choose the right one. Make sure to uncheck the option <strong>Automatically load data</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>var ds = widget.datasource;
if(!app.user.role.Admins){
  ds.query.filters.Email._equals = app.user.email;
}
ds.load();
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the trick. In regards to the permission issue with the admin role, make sure that the model has the proper permissions. For that, go the the model's <strong>SECURITY</strong>
tab and make sure to set the proper permissions.</p>

55090674,How do I create a record and have it relate to the parent in Google Apps Maker?,"<p>Probably such a basic question but having some issues.  I'm not a big developer; most of the stuff I've done has been in things like FileMaker or Salesforce where it's more limited coding.  I'm messing with Google App Maker and it seems really straightforward but I'm having issues with a basic function that I can't seem to find help on.  Everything else I have working fine.</p>

<p>Super basic example, let's say I have a table called Accounts, and then a related table called Contacts.  One Account can have many Contacts.  On the Account page I have a table that shows all the Contacts related to that Account.</p>

<p>From the Account page I have a button that opens a popup with another page to Create a Contact.  I'm just not clear on how I set it to relate that Contact to that Account and don't want to reinvent the wheel.  If I put the ""Account"" lookup field on the new Contact page, and manually select the Account when making the Contact, it of course works.  However if I'm on an Account page already, and I'm creating a Contact, I want that Contact to automatically be linked to that Account without having to manually select it.  Super straightforward, I'm just not clear on if there's a way to do this built in, or if I would be doing it as a custom action when using the OnClick event for the ""Save"" button on the new Contact window etc.  Or if I (hopefully not) have to do it via coding like under scripts.</p>

<p>So I have 2 questions:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> How can I set 'MailingAddress' and 'OtherAddress' fields using API parameter only?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Is there any manual/documentation for this reference? As I am also having trouble with 'OtherLatitude' and 'OtherLogitude' fields.</p>
","<p>Address and geolocation fields are compound fields.</p>

I'd like to have each line of a drop-down widget read ""Doe, John"" using the Employees datasource.  I can bind the names array of a drop-down widget to one field or the other pretty easily by editing the ""names"" field of the widget:</p>

<p><code>=@datasources.Employees.item.last_name</code> yields Doe, and 
<code>=@datasources.Employees.item.first_name</code> yields John in the dropdown's first list item, respectively.</p>

<p>Concatenating a static string to the field also works:</p>

<p><code>=@datasources.Employees.item.last_name + ""-test""</code> yields Doe-test in the drop-down</p>

<p>However, when I try to modify this binding to combine the two fields, it doesn't work:</p>

<p><code>=@datasources.Employees.item.last_name + "", "" + @datasource.item.Employees.first_name</code> yields just Doe</p>

<p>Even dumping both fields into an array and joining them:</p>

<p>The only way I've found to get the values of two different fields from a record together on the same line in a drop-down widget is to use client scripting to populate the names array of the widget during the onDataLoad event:</p>

<pre><code>app.datasources.Employees.load(function() {
  app.datasources.Employees.items.forEach(
    item =&gt; widget.names.push([item.last_name, item.first_name].join("", ""))

<p>where SortField and sortOrder are variables set as follows:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateContext({SortOrignatorDescending: !SortOrignatorDescending, SortField: ""Originator""});Set(sortOrder, If(SortOrignatorDescending, Descending, Ascending))
</code></pre>

<p>Variable is updated in three places, one is with the Title column, the other two are Person columns. For the Title column the above code works fine but for the Person column does not work. </p>

<p>I found out that the problem is the SortByColumns and Sort functions does not know by which property to sort the Person column. Any idea how to provide dynamically the column name along with the DisplayName property to the Sort/SortByColumns functions?</p>

<p>So far I've tested to pass the DisplayName property with the column name as a string:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateContext({SortAllocatedToDescending: !SortAllocatedToDescending, SortField:""AllocatedTo.DisplayName""});Set(sortOrder, If(SortAllocatedToDescending, Descending, Ascending))

<p>and did try to set the variable to the column itself:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateContext({SortAllocatedToDescending: !SortAllocatedToDescending, SortField:AllocatedTo});Set(sortOrder, If(SortAllocatedToDescending, Descending, Ascending))
</code></pre>

<p>But got an error in the designer that it got incompatible type. I assume columns could not directly be passed through variables.</p>

<p>Also did try to use both functions(Sort and SortByColumns) interchangeably but to no avail.</p>

<p>The main goal is to have sorting, filtering and searching for specific string at the same time for multiple columns and to be easy to add more criteria/columns to the formula without adding one and the same statement multiple times.</p>

55196502,How to bind two distinct datasources to a common dropdown,"<p>I need to bind and refresh two distinct datasources to one single dropdown.</p>

<p>Datasources:</p>

<ul>
<li>device_info</li>
<li>device_measurements</li>
</ul>

<p>Dropdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>device_list</li>
</ul>

<p>As the selected item should serve as parameter for querying the datasources, the first difficulty I encountered was that I couldn't managed to bind the dropdown's value to the two datasources.</p>

<p>So did what follows.</p>

<p>Dropdown's value is set to <code>@models.device_info.datasources.device_info.properties.deviceId</code></p>

<p>Dropdown's onValueChange event is set to <code>loadDeviceInformationDataSources();</code></p>

<p>loadDeviceInformation definition is</p>

<pre><code>function loadDeviceInformationDataSources() {
  app.datasources.device_info.load();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each datasource has a parameter called deviceId (type String) and references a query script:</p>

<ul>
<li>device_info's query script is <code>return getDeviceInformation(query);</code></li>
<li>device_measurements's query script is <code>return getDeviceMeasurements(query);</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, the scripts are:</p>

<pre><code>function getDeviceInformation(query) {
  var deviceId = query.parameters.deviceId;
  console.log('Get device information for:', deviceId);

  var deviceInfo = firestore.getDocument('devices/' + deviceId);

  var record = app.models.device_info.newRecord();
  record.name = deviceInfo.fields.name;
  record.online = deviceInfo.fields.online;
  record.type = deviceInfo.fields.type;
  record.brightness = deviceInfo.fields['state'].brightness;
  record.on = deviceInfo.fields['state'].on;

  var records = [];
  records.push(record);

  // Load measurements
  var measurementsQuery = app.models.device_measurements.newQuery();
  measurementsQuery.where = 'deviceId = :deviceId';
  measurementsQuery.parameters.deviceId = deviceId;
  measurementsQuery.run();

  return records;
}

function getDeviceMeasurements(query) {
  var deviceId = query.parameters.deviceId || 'device-01' ;
  var records = [];

  var deviceMeasurements = firestore.getDocuments('devices/' + deviceId + '/measurements');


  deviceMeasurements.map(function(measure) {
    var record = app.models.device_measurements.newRecord();
    record.timestamp = measure.fields.timestamp;
    record.intensity = measure.fields.intensity;
    records.push(record);
  });

  return records;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To display data I use one table per datasource.</p>

<p>The datasource device_info is correctly loaded each time I select a device in the dropdown list and the related table gets refreshed.</p>

<p>As to the datasource device_measurements, the datasource gets loaded each time I select a device in the dropdown (I can see that when logging to the console) BUT the related table does not get refreshed (like if the programmatic <code>measurementsQuery.run();</code> would not tell the table to refresh).</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I doing something wrong?</li>
<li>Is there a better way to achieve that?</li>

","<p>I don't know that much about salesforce, but ""require"" is something from node.js, not a function that is implemented in the browser.</p>

<p>If I understand the documentation correctly, then for a browser project it should be enough to call the jsforce script via a script tag. You should not need any way to ""require"" files after that, since the jsforce script already contains everything you need. So you should be fine if you just remove the offending lines (i.e. all references to ""require('jsforce');"").</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id=""app""&gt;
    &lt;router-view/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
@import url(""/node_modules/@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/styles/salesforce-lightning-design-system.min.css"");

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url(""data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='100' height='100' viewBox='0 0 100 100'%3E%3Cg stroke='%23CCC' stroke-width='0' %3E%3Crect fill='%23F5F5F5' x='-60' y='-60' width='110' height='240'/%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E"");
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I added the classes to a simple button:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class=""slds-button slds-button_brand"" @click=""createTask""&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This does nothing. Classes are applied, but no styling.</p>

<p>I tried adding it to my main.ts:</p>

<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';
import store from './store';
import '../node_modules/@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/styles/salesforce-lightning-design-system.min.css'
Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
  router,
  store,
  render: (h) =&gt; h(App),
}).$mount('#app');
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the whole build fail because it says it can't resolve the module:</p>

<pre><code>./src/main.ts
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../node_modules/@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/styles/salesforce-lightning-design-system.min.css' in '/usr/src/app/src'
</code></pre>

<p>This happens even though the dependency is in my <code>package.json</code> and the autocomplete in vscode shows me the relative path. I've tried diferent relative paths and none of them work. What's going on here?</p>

However, the end users do not have a Microsoft account (they will have a salesforce account) and I will be using a different Microsoft account (lets say impersonation account) to connect to Power BI via Azure AD.</p>

<p>When I open the visual force page from salesforce it first goes to the Microsoft login screen and once I enter the impersonation account username and password only then embeds the entire report in salesforce. Is there a way to directly log into Microsoft using the impersonation account from salesforce? (the end users will not have a Microsoft account). Any help is much appreciated.</p>

55283256,google.script.run in App Maker: TypeError: Cannot read property 'withLogger' of undefined,"<p>I'm developing an App Maker app and from a <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/client"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">client-side script</a>, I have to make calls to server side functions - suppose function <code>a</code> and function <code>b</code> - that are dependent on each other.</p>

<p>The first (native) solution in client-side script was the following, which uses callbacks:</p>

<pre><code>function doB(s) {
    google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) { // async workload
        console.log(result);
    }).withFailureHandler(function(error) {
        console.log(error);
    }).b(s);
}

function aThenB(s) {
    google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) { // async workload
        console.log(result);
        doB(result); // call b
    }).withFailureHandler(function(error) {
        console.log(error);
    }).a(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if you have to then call function <code>c</code>, and then <code>d</code>, etc, with the results of these related function executions, this becomes very unwieldy. I read <a href=""http://ramblings.mcpher.com/Home/excelquirks/gassnips/googlescriptruntidy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, which describes converting from callback to Promise, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function runnerToPromise(f) {
    var runArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).slice(1);
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { // executor
        google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
            resolve(result); // resolve promise
        }).withFailureHandler(function(error) {
            reject(error); // reject promise
        })[f].apply(this, runArgs); // async
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which would make the above code look like:</p>

<pre><code>function aThenB(s) {
    return runnerToPromise('a', s).then(
        function(result) {
            return runnerToPromise('b', result);
        }
    );
}

function runAThenB(s) {
    aThenB(s).then(function(result) {
        console.log('SUCCESS: ' + result);
    }).catch(function(error) {
        console.log(error);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This solution works properly if you use Apps Script and <code>HtmlService</code>, and deploy the script as ""Web App.""</strong></p>

<p>However, in App Maker, it throws an error that I cannot understand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeError: Cannot read property 'withLogger' of undefined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I resolve this App Maker-only error?</p>

<hr>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>I made a new test app with App Maker to reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>The app just does that: it copies, in two steps, the data from a spreadsheet to another spreadsheet.</p>

<p>I ran the code in App Maker and I also deployed the code as a Web Application made with Apps Script.</p>

<p>No problem with the Web Application made with Apps Script; in App Maker only the solution that uses callbacks works properly.</p>

<p>Server side script:</p>

<pre><code>function serverStepOne() {

    console.log('serverStepOne fn called!');

    return SpreadsheetApp

        .openById('XXX') // Spreadsheet A

        .getSheetByName('A')

        .getDataRange()

        .getValues();
}

function serverStepTwo(grid) {

    console.log('serverStepTwo fn called!');

    SpreadsheetApp

        .openById('YYY') // Spreadsheet B

        .getSheetByName('A').getRange(1, 1, grid.length, grid[0].length).setValues(grid); // all rows have the same number of cells

        return 'copy done!';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Client side script:</p>

<pre><code>function copyData() { // messy one... works like a charm in App Maker

    google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {

        google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {console.log(result);}).withFailureHandler(function(error) {console.log(error);}).serverStepTwo(result);

    }).withFailureHandler(function(error) {console.log(error);}).serverStepOne();
}

function runnerToPromise(f) {

    var runArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).slice(1);

    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

        google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {

            resolve(result);

        }).withFailureHandler(function(error) {

            reject(error);

        })[f].apply(this, runArgs);
    });
}

function copyDataPromise() { // tidy one... doesn't work in App Maker; works in Apps Script Web App

    return runnerToPromise('serverStepOne').then(

    function(result) {

        return runnerToPromise('serverStepTwo', result);
    });
}

function runCopyDataPromise() {

    copyDataPromise().then(function(result) {console.log(result);}).catch(function(error) {console.log(error);});
}
</code></pre>

<p>App Maker, when the copyDataPromise fn is called, produces the following log in the browser's console:</p>

<h2>UPDATE 3</h2>

<p>I've tried the code below. It works in an Apps Script Web App. It doesn't work in App Maker. In App Maker it throws the same error: <strong>Cannot read property 'withLogger' of undefined</strong></p>

          .withFailureHandler(reject);

        if (task[fn] === undefined) {

          reject(""'"" + fn + ""' is not a global function in your Apps Script project"");

        } else {

          task[fn].apply(null, args);
        }
      });
    };

    function copyDataPromiseSpread() {

      return runnerToPromiseSpread('serverStepOne')

        .then((result) =&gt; {

55286040,How to increment counter value inside an onClick event?,"<p>I'm quite new to Google App Maker and programming in general, I'm making an app where when a ""+"" button is clicked (onClick event) fields are added (kinda like a new row in a table with every click). I'm trying to make a counter to keep track of how many ""rows"" are being created. The thing is that since in App Maker all the code apparently has to be made inside the onClick event, i can't set a global variable and every time the button is clicked the counter restarts, therefore always being 1. </p>

<p>I tried with localStorage but i don't exactly know how to make it work, since it still will always save the same value. How can i fix this?</p>

<pre><code>  var count = 0;
  count = count +1;

","<p>You should get data from <code>localStorage</code> first, then increment it and finally set the new value the <code>localStorage</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks.   </p>

<p><hr><hr></p>

<p>Update(2019-3-27):</p>

<p>I was able to make it work by putting everything inside the <em>for loop</em> block. However, I have another question.</p>

<p>Is there any method like the below sample code?</p>

<pre><code>var recordData = [Data1, Data2, Data3] 
var ceateDatasource;
var newItem = new Array(recordData.length) ;

for(var i = 0 ; i &lt; recordData.length; i ++) {
  ceateDatasource = app.datasources.Reservation.modes.create;
  newItem[i] = ceateDatasource.item;

  newItem[i].User            = recordData[i].user;
  newItem[i].Description     = recordData[i].Description;
  newItem[i].Location_Lab_fk = recordData[i].Location_Lab_fk;
  newItem[i].Area_fk         = recordData[i].Area_fk;
  newItem[i].Equipment_fk    = recordData[i].Equipment_fk;

  newItem[i].Start_Date    = recordData[i].Start_Date;
  newItem[i].Start_Hours   = recordData[i].Start_Hours;
  newItem[i].Start_Minutes = recordData[i].Start_Minutes;

  newItem[i].End_Date    = recordData[i].End_Date;
  newItem[i].End_Hours   = recordData[i].End_Hours;
  newItem[i].End_Minutes = recordData[i].End_Minutes;
}

// Create the new item
ceateDatasource.createItem();
</code></pre>

<p>First, it prepares an array 'newItem' and only calls 'ceateDatasource.createItem()' one time to save all new records(or items).
I try to use this method, but it only saves the last record 'newItem[3]'.</p>

<p>I need to write a callback function in 'ceateDatasource.createItem()' but Google App Maker always show a warning ""Don't make functions within a loop"". So, are there any methods to call 'createItem()' one time to save several records? Or are there some functions like 'array.push' which can be used? </p>

<p>Thanks.  </p>
","<p>As per AppMaker's <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/api/client#CreateDataSource"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A create datasource is a datasource used to create items in a particular data source. Its <strong>item</strong> property is always populated by a <strong>draft item</strong> which can be bound to or set programmatically. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you are trying to do is create three items off the same draft item. That why you see the result you get. If you want to create multiple items, you need to create a draft item for each one, hence all you need to do is put all your code inside the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0 ; i &lt; 3; i ++) {

  var ceateDatasource = app.datasources.Reservation.modes.create;
  var newItem = ceateDatasource.item;

  newItem.User = user; //'eric'
  newItem.Description = description; //'000'
  newItem.Location_Lab_fk = lab.value.Id; //'T'
  newItem.Area_fk = area.value.Id; //'L'
  newItem.Equipment_fk = equipment.value.Id; //'S'

  newItem.Start_Date = startDate;
  newItem.Start_Hours = '03';
  newItem.Start_Minutes = '00';

  newItem.End_Date = startDate;
  newItem.End_Hours = '23';
  newItem.End_Minutes = '30';

  // Create the new item
  ceateDatasource.createItem();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to save several records at the same time using client script, then what you are looking for is the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#manual_save_mode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Manual Save Mode</strong></a>. So all you have to do is go to your model's datasource and click on the checkbox ""Manual Save Mode"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydq1O.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydq1O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then use the same code as above. The only difference is that in order to persist the changes to the server, you need to explicitly save changes. So all you have to do is add the following after the <em>for loop</em> block:</p>

<pre><code>app.datasources.Reservation.saveChanges(function(){
     //TODO: Callback handler
});

","<p>If you want to have all strings instead of one of them, you can slightly change the logic of the expression. Before it would sum 1 if a word is in the title, and check that the result is more than 0 (so if any is present, then the item would be returned). In this modified expression below, we're adding 1 if each word <strong>is not</strong> in the title, and at the end we compare the sum with 0 - if it's not zero, then at least one word was not found, and we don't return the record.</p>

55366951,How to dynamically switch color themes using SASS?,"<p>I'm trying to implement switchable themes for a project, it's a Mendix project, but let's suppose it's a website. </p>

<ul>
<li>There are many different pages, and different elements on each page.     </li>
<li>All styles for them are written in SASS. The pages and elements use values from one separate SASS file with variables - <strong>variables-1</strong>.</li>
<li>I have a second SASS file with the same variables but different values - <strong>variables-2</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
I need to change the color theme of the website on a button click. So basically I need all the elements to take colors from the different set of variables when I click a button.</p>

<hr>

<p>I see two options here:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compile 2 css files and switch between them: link all sass files to <strong>variables-1</strong>, compile CSS file, then link all sass files to <strong>variables-2</strong>, compile second css file. Switch between them on a button click.</p>

<p>In this option, colors won't be assigned dynamically, and every time when I make changes I will have to manually link each sass file to different variables, or change variables values, and recompile everything. Also I won't be able to continue working on the project and switch themes at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Predefine color themes in mixins, compile css classes for each theme like in <a href=""https://medium.com/@dmitriy.borodiy/easy-color-theming-with-scss-bc38fd5734d1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, and use some custom js logic to assign corresponding classes to the elements.</p>

<p>Most likely won't work, since there are too many elements in the project, and would be too complicated to change class for each one.</p></li>

55405120,"Is there a way to access the fields of a record, selected by a radio button widget in Google App Maker?","<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>I am fairly new to AppMaker and this question centres on hierarchies. I have a Taxonomy table with a straight forward parent has children hierarchical relationship.</p>

<p>TaxonomyGroup -> has many Features -> has many Values</p>

<p>I've been working on a way to traverse this hierarchy using <strong>tile/grid widget</strong>.</p>

<p>When I reach the last node of the tree-structure I display this as a set of radio-buttons, representing the permitted options.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Starting group is: <em>Car</em></p>

<p>a Car has the following <em>features:</em></p>

<p>-<em>Colour</em>
    -Red
    -Blue
    -Silver
    -Green</p>

<p>-<em>Transmission</em>
    -Automatic
    -Manual</p>

<p>-<em>Fuel</em>
    -Petrol
    -Hybrid
    -Electric</p>

<p>If the parent group was Motorcycle, I would have a different set of features and options (permitted values).</p>

<p>A user selects the following for a Car: </p>

<p>+Colour
    -Silver</p>

<p>+Trans 
    -Automatic </p>

<p>+Fuel 
    -Electric </p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>While I can capture Silver, Automatic, Electric as the options selected, I cannot pick up the ID or any other fields of the record represented by the radio button selected.</p>

<h3>Grid widget set-up</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taxonomy Grid Panel.....   parent layer DS = Taxonomy (table) Id In [list]</p>
  
  <p>Taxonomy Grid Child panel 'child' layer DS = TaxonomyChildren, ParentId = :parent</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Radio button list DS = TaxonomyChildren: SubGroups (relation)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>NB the radio button list sits within the Taxonomy Grid Child panel, so the list of options changes, based on the feature.</p>

<h3>Radio button code onValueEdit event</h3>

<pre><code>// provides the row index of the selected Feature. e.g 'Transmission'

var rowIndex = widget.root.descendants.TaxonomyChildGridPanel.selectedIndex;

if (rowIndex === 0 ){   
 widget.root.descendants.Feature1.ID = widget.datasource.item.Id;
} else if rowIndex ===1 { 
 widget.root.descendants.Feature2.ID = widget.datasource.item.Id;
  }
: //etc etc   
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Radio button widget issue</h3>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>widget.datasource.item.Id</em> </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>returns only the ID for the 1st item in the radio button list.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>E.g. record ID 117 representing the option 'Petrol' not Electric as the radio button option selected. </p>

<p>I need to be able to capture the record behind the radio button selection, representing the node (called values) of the tree structure. In particular the ID of the record. Then store it against the creation of a new record, in this example a new Car record.</p>

<p>At present: onValueEdit event: the wrong record_ID is provided and it is always the 1st option in the radio-button list, irrespective of which option was chosen.</p>

","<p>App Maker has ups and downs and you just need to find workarounds for the downs. I just dealt with the import of a huge database that contained over a half million records and it was quite a challenge. </p>

<p>In your case, I'd recommend to save items in batches to speed up the process. I think that saving records in batches of 2000 should be enough. </p>

<p>You can do something like this:</p>

    //get the data
    var data = getData();

    var totalRecords = data.length;
    var batchLimit = 2000;

    var round = 1;
    var roundlimit = batchLimit;
    var currentItem = 0;

    do{
        var recordsToSave = [];
        for(var i=currentItem; i&lt;roundlimit; i++){

55476156,Appmaker - How to enforce validation for suggest box when value is not selected from the options?,"<p>I have a form which contains a suggest box. When I click on submit one of the requirement is to not submit the form if the value is not selected from the options.</p>

<p>The problem occurs when we select a value and then clear it and then enter a text not chosen from the options. (Scenario quite possible as some users may not know that value is only to be chosen from the options etc)
In this case the value is still the old one and so the validation does not show any error thus creating an illusion for the user that the text which he entered is accepted as the value.</p>

55484404,Did I reinvent the wheel with multiple user access to 3rd party API within Google Apps Script?,"<p>I'm developing a system which, when submitting a form through Google Forms, a script will take the data from the sheet which the data is submitted to and then set up a project in a project management software (Zoho projects), and also create Google folder structures based on the information provided.</p>

<p>In other words, a google form is the one location from which all project infrastructure will be created in their corresponding locations and software.</p>

<p>In order for this system to work properly, I need every user who has access to the form to be able to perform the same actions on every software which the script is tied to, regardless of their permissions level for each.</p>

<p>This necessitates the script using only one set of credentials for the 3rd party API which is authorized at a high level, and having all users of the form access only those credentials in order to get the consistent results that are needed.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that I cannot (or at least I don't think I can,) use the OAuth2.0 library for GAS, as user authentication would be to access only the data which the user operating the software has; this would produce many errors in the code because utilizing credentials of different authority levels while attempting to perform the same tasks which require high levels of authority would yield many errors, and lead to inconsistent functionality with the script. On top of this, because I'm referencing a 3rd party API, there's no ""Service Account"" that I can use to act on behalf of highly authorized users.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, I've built my own wrapper library for this API in Google Apps Script and built my own authentication system in which user credentials are automatically renewed and managed using the PropertiesService capabilities. I have established access to a highly-authorized user's data through this system. I access this data in my script instead of authenticating with the OAuth2 library for Google Apps Script in order to allow consistent results from the software.</p>

<p>I've found my own method that works for this scenario, but after all the work I've went through, am wondering if I have reinvented the wheel. Is there any other more established way to have multiple users interface with one set of credentials of a 3rd party API through Google Apps Script? Or is this a unique situation that required the solution that I came up with?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

55489868,Binding values to multiple labels in a List Widget; Using Dynamic Page Properties,"<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I have a JSON object and I would like to bind it's values to a List Widget using a Dynamic Page Property. I am trying to set a dynamic page properties ""value"" to be a JSON Object, however I am not sure how to access that JSON's Approver's Elements.</p>

<h2>Setting the Page Property ""Value""</h2>

<p>As I understand the dynamic page property should be able to accept a JSON object. In the below sample I do just that.</p>

<pre><code>var jsonObject = {
    ""Approvers"": [{
        ""Approver_Name"": ""John Doe"",
        ""Approver_Email"": ""jdoe@email.com,"",
        ""Approver_Status"": ""Pending""
    }, {
        ""Approver_Name"": ""Jane Doe"",
        ""Approver_Email"": ""jdoe2@email.com,"",
        ""Approver_Status"": ""Pending""
    }]
}
    app.pages.editSubmission.properties.Approver_Details = jsonObject;
</code></pre>

<h2>Accessing values in Page Property</h2>

<p>I have read the documentation regarding properties and bindings. <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/properties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/properties</a>. I have tried the standard method of binding the List Widget's datasource to be Dynamic Page Property. (I am still not sure how access the elements of Approvers.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately the documentation doesn't cover dynamic properties. (Or I missed it.) If anyone can point me to some documentation or another stack overflow post covering this topic it would be greatly appropriated.</p>
","<p>A <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/api/widgets#List"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">List Widget</a> expects its datasource to be an array of items, but you are providing a json object; hence it's not working. Instead of using a <code>dynamic property</code> use a <code>&lt;List&gt;String</code> property. That way you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonObject = {
    ""Approvers"": [{
        ""Approver_Name"": ""John Doe"",
        ""Approver_Email"": ""jdoe@email.com"",
        ""Approver_Status"": ""Pending""
    }, {
        ""Approver_Name"": ""Jane Doe"",
        ""Approver_Email"": ""jdoe2@email.com"",
        ""Approver_Status"": ""Pending""
    }]
}
app.pages.editSubmission.properties.Approver_Details = jsonObject.Approvers;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when binding the values to your list, you can use three different labels inside the list row and each label has to be binded to the corresponding value:</p>

<pre><code>@datasource.item[""Approver_Name""]
@datasource.item[""Approver_Email""]
@datasource.item[""Approver_Status""]

55525227,"PowerApps - ""Set Regarding"" for an appointment in CRM","<p>So I need to essentially create a PowerApp which would make appointments in Dynamics CRM. All data gets sent to CRM - except the case regarding the appointment.</p>

<p>Originally, I was using the normal <code>SubmitForm()</code> but switched over to the <code>Patch()</code> function. I have set the <code>_regardingobjectid_value</code> to a valid case GUID. The problem lies with <code>_regardingobjectid_type</code> - as for some reason, I cannot set the entity name. In this case, the entity name would be ""incident"", but it keeps throwing an error that states that it needs another GUID. I really don't know what to do anymore. </p>

<p>This is the code I am using:</p>

<pre><code>Patch(
      Appointments;  
      Defaults(Appointments); 
      {
         Subject: txtSubject.Text; 
         'Start Time': DateTimeValue(_selectedStartTime); 
         'End Time': DateTimeValue(_selectedEndTime);
          Description:txtDescription.Text;
          _regardingobjectid_value: _regarding;
          _regardingobjectid_type: incident 
       }
)
</code></pre>

<p>So to clarify, I would just really like to have my appointment have the specified case regarded to it. 
At the moment I am getting an error stating that incident ""name is invalid"". If I remove the type, I get an ambigious error. And when I set the case id to the type, it does input my record into Dynamics, however with no case (understandably so). </p>

61143493,How to upload files and attachments to the sobject record using REST API?,"<p>Salesforce has two different UIs and in accordance with it, it has the possibility to store attached files differently.
Two files were uploaded via the classic UI and they are marked as 'attachments'. Other files were uploaded through the new UI and they are marked as 'files'.
I want to upload all of these files using REST API. I cannot find the proper documentation. Can somebody help me with this?</p>
","<p>That's not 100% true. In SF Classic UI you were able to upload Files too. It's ""just"" about knowing the right API name of the table and you'll find lots of examples online.</p>

<p><code>Attachment</code> and <code>Document</code> objects have exactly same API names, you can view their definitions in <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_attachment.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOAP API definition</a> or in REST API explorer (there was something which you can still see in screenshot in <a href=""https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/292654/using-salesforce-api-explorer-for-documenting-apex-rest-services"">here</a>, seems to be down now, maybe they're moving it to another area in documentation...)</p>

<p>The Files (incl. ""Chatter Files"") are stored in <code>ContentDocument</code> and <code>ContentVersion</code> object. The name is unexpected because long time ago SF purchased another company's product and it was called ""Salesforce Content"". In beginning it was bit of mess, now it's better integrated into whole platform but still some things lurk like File folders can be called Libraries sometimes in documentation but actual API name is <code>ContentWorkspace</code>. The entity relationship diagram can help a bit: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm</a></p>

<p><code>ContentDocument</code> is a header to which many places in SF link (imagine file wasting space on disk only once but being cross-linked from multiple records). It can have at least 1 version and if you need to update the document - you'd upload new version but all links in org wouldn't change, they'd still link to header.</p>

<p>So, how to use it? </p>

<ul>
<li>REST API guide: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm</a></li>
<li>or maybe Chatter API guide (you tagged it with chatter so chances are you already use it): <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_files.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_files.htm</a></li>
<li>some of my answers here might help (shameless plug). They're about upload and reading data too and one is even about data loader... but you might experiment with exporting files first, get familiar with structure before you load?

61221088,Why i need to set the parentId for each record for Queueable Apex,"<p>Hope you are well and doing well in these times,Below is a  common scenario to take some set of sObject records, execute some processing such as making a callout to an external REST endpoint or perform some calculations and then update them in the database asynchronously. . The following code takes a collection of Account records, sets the parentId for each record, and then updates the records in the database.</p>

<p>My questions are:-</p>

<p><code>A) Why i need to set the parentId for each record for Queueable Apex?</code></p>

<p><code>B) Why i cant use public identifier (mind you i know differences between public and private identifier :)) but why here we used private  in Queueable Apex and then we have to set the values?</code></p>

<pre><code>public class UpdateParentAccount implements Queueable {

private List&lt;Account&gt; accounts;
private ID parent;

public UpdateParentAccount(List&lt;Account&gt; records, ID id) {
    this.accounts = records;
    this.parent = id;
}
public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
    for (Account account : accounts) {
      account.parentId = parent;
      // perform other processing or callout
    }
    update accounts;
   }

}

","<p>Setting of a parent ID is an example of a task that can be done asynchronously. This is a somewhat poorly chosen example because the same task <em>could</em> be done synchronously without Queuable. (If there are a lot of Account records being updated then moving this task to async might be a good idea).</p>

<p>Public versus private - making a field private is a best practice as a way of encapsulating data in a class. It is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, thus preventing direct access to them. In case of a Queuable, this is kinda like a utility class that will be used in a very specific context so you could make the variables public and remove the constructor. </p>

61222090,Extract Salesforce Objects and Load them into SQLLite Database Tables- Python3,"<p>I am trying to collect data from salesforce and then load them into sqllite tables.</p>

<p>It should give you a good idea which classes/triggers are least covered. Some of these will be quick wins, time spent on creating/improving their tests will give you best results in oveall coverage. I mean it's better to spend 1h fixing class that has 60 out of 100 lines covered than class that has 2 out of 4 covered. Work in sandbox till you're > 75%</p>

<p>(there's a chance your sandbox is outdated and somebody created validation rules, required fields etc straight in production without deploying... that's why I asked to compile &amp; run all tests in prod)</p>

<p>If there are classes/methods that aren't used anymore and it'd be safe to delete them - you can't do it with changeset, you need a special destructive deployment. For now you could comment them out and deploy that version. Just check if this is beneficial for you (I mean of course it's good to get rid of old code, easier maintenance... but if it happens to be well covered with tests you'll shoot yourself in the foot)</p>

<p>Add the created/updated test classes to changeset and you should be able to deploy it to prod.</p>

{""value"": 4, ""label"": ""{""value"": 1, ""label"": ""apple""}""},..., {""value"": 1000, ""label"": ""..some fruit 
string alphanumeric with every possible special character..""}

<p>I need to work by Regex in order to get the correct list of keys: <strong>value</strong> and <strong>label</strong>.
Power Apps docs provide some match functions: <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-ismatch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IsMatch, Match, and MatchAll functions in Power Apps</a></p>

<p>but I'm not able to get <em>""value""</em> and <em>""label""</em> keys in order to replace them without double quotes like: <em>value</em>, <em>label</em> obtaining this result:
    {<strong>value</strong>: 1, <strong>label</strong>: ""apple""},{<strong>value</strong>: 2, <strong>label</strong>: ""pineapple""}, {<strong>value</strong>: 3, 
    <strong>label</strong>: ""peach""}, 
    {<strong>value</strong>: 4, <strong>label</strong>: ""{""value"": 1, ""label"": ""apple""}""},..., {<strong>value</strong>: 1000, <strong>label</strong>: 
    ""..some fruit

<p>My remarks are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the complete string could contains a different number of items grouped by braces: one item corresponds 
to { , }</li>
<li>the value related of key <em>""value""</em> contains always a number from 0 to 999999</li>
<li>the value related of key <em>""label""</em> is a string that can contain all possibile types of characters 
(special chars, word, numbers and spaces)</li>
<li>take glance that a sting <em>""label""</em> value could contain a same structure with the same values of the compete Text 
string itself, so for example the Regex mustn't find the <em>""label""</em> or <em>""value""</em> or any separator 
inside the string key label value:</li>
</ul>

<p>..4, ""<strong>label</strong>"": ""{""value"": 1, ""label"": ""apple""}""},    is OK for me because find the key (the first <em>""label""</em>)</p>

<p>..4, ""<strong>label</strong>"": ""{""<strong>value</strong>"": 1, ""<strong>label</strong>: ""apple""}""},     is WRONG the bold match because retrieve also another 
                                                        <em>""label""</em> and/or <em>""value""</em> inside the string value of the key.</p>

<p>1.Add Attachments checkbox field to Activity Task object (Attachment Indicator)
2.Add Attachments checkbox field to Case object (Task Attachment)

     --> Letter Reviewer Queue
4.Add column to Related Lists for Activities
     --> Open Activities and Activities History on the Case in the Related tab from the Activity
     --> View all list of Activities for Case selected from the Activity
5.Allow field to be reported on from the ""Activity with Cases"" report type</p>

<p><strong>System Task:</strong></p>

<p>1) Automatically update ""Attachment Indicator"" checkbox on the Activity Task (Checked). Create process flow that updates (checks) the field in the Activity when an attachment file is added for any Action selected
2) Automatically update ""Task Attachment"" checkbox on Case (Checked). Create process flow that updates (checks) the field in the Case when an attachment file is added to an open Activity Task where Action is ""Intermediate Letter Review"" and Activity Task Attachments checkbox is checked</p>

<p>Now, this works but I'm using the LWC ESLint rules, and when I do this, I get an error/warning ""no-api-reassignment"" because I'm assigning the api properties in my connectedCallback.

<p>Which seems reasonable, though it very similar to the pattern that the Salesforce Lightning Spinner shows.
<a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-spinner/documentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-spinner/documentation</a></p>

<p>So I'm just looking for advice on the best way to handle this or if I should just disable the ESLint rule. Other things to consider are how to test this stuff, the reactivity with the API decorator has made things pretty easy on my end but I don't want to continue if I'm not using the best approach.</p>

<p>In Power Apps, you can use the function <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-char"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Char(10)</a> to add a new line to a string.

Collect(testArray, ""B"", ""C"");
Set(result, Concat(testArray, testString &amp; Value &amp; Char(10)))

61462588,How to upload the file to the user`s 'Files' tab using system admin token (REST API)?,"<p>As a system administrator, I want to fetch all the files from my organization uploaded by different users.
To achieve my goal I use the request to <code>GET /services/data/v48.0/query/?q=SELECT+Id+FROM+ContentDocument+USING+SCOPE+Everything</code>. 
But here is the following problem: when the user deletes his file, I want to upload that file back using a system admin token, but with the possibility to change its owner (back to that user who deletes that file). 
Can anyone help me to solve such a problem?</p>
","<p>It's bit counter-intuitive but to upload a File you need to upload <code>ContentVersion</code> record. If the parent lookup (<code>ContentDocumentId</code>) field will be blank - it'll silently create the parent <code>ContentDocument</code> for you.</p>

<p>Examples of upload can be found here: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm</a> </p>

<p>(I've already answered that for you, didn't I? :))</p>

<p>So the only difference would be that you want to set <code>OwnerId</code>, possibly also <code>CreatedById</code> as that user. You can set Owner always as long as the owner is an active user. ""Created By"", ""Last Modified By"" are audit fields, normally not editable. If the owner is inactive or you really want to set ""Created By"" - you can. But you have only 1 shot at this, audit fields can be set only on insert. After that every update is managed by SF. Check <a href=""https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000334139&amp;language=en_US&amp;type=1&amp;mode=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Help</a> if you need more info on this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now... this isn't always needed. OK, you will recreate the file but all links to it (from other records, from chatter posts, libraries) will be lost. It's in <code>ContentDOcumentLink</code> and if you delete the document - they cascade delete. You might not have info or permissions to recreate all the links.</p>

<p>Your first line of defense could be checking whether file can be restored from Recycle Bin. It can't be done in pure REST API but you could use SF SOAP API or write an Apex service that would try to do that for you. See <a href=""https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/117370/how-can-a-record-be-undeleted-using-the-rest-api"">https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/117370/how-can-a-record-be-undeleted-using-the-rest-api</a> for tips.</p>

<p>I open some other payment (Id in URL: a001l000005HK5mBBK) in the same browser window and modify a field value in this payment and save it. At this moment recordUpdated method is called twice once for the old payment and once for the new payment.</p>

Updated record Id: a001l000005JP5mAAG
changeType IS: CHANGED
Updated record Id: a001l000005HK5mBBK

<p>Not sure why it is calling twice and how to stop it? Can anybody explain me why it acting like that and how to stop it?</p>

<p>Surprisingly if I open more payments in the same browser window and modify them it keeps adding recordUpdated event for the current payment updated and also calls update event of earlier payments with their Id.</p>

61647756,Salesforce: retrieve images via REST API from RFT fields in custom objects,"<p>How can one retrieve images from Salesforce (SF) via its REST API that are embedded as links in RTF fields in custom objects?</p>
","<p>We aim to extract information from SF via its REST API in order to generate a report in Word format. To to so we need to run queries into the SF custom objects that contain the relevant information. Typically, we are looking to get this information from a collection of custom objects.</p>

<p>One of the custom fields contains an RTF field which contain links to the relevant images. These images are displayed when the objects are viewed in the SF UI. 
There are several entries in both StackOverflow and Salesforce:StackExchange regarding this topic. Many of these entries discuss Apex methods. The ones that discuss retrieving the images via the REST API did not allow me to be successful.</p>

<p>An entry in the SF REST API developer guide <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_sobject_rich_text_image_retrieve.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> instructs us how to achieve this: 
send a request to the REST API via a GET as follows:</p>

<pre><code> /vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/id/richTextImageFields/fieldName/contentReferenceId 
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is to determine what is the SObjectName, the id, the fieldName and the contentReferenceId.
We can get the names from the SF database schema we are working with. Fortunately, we can get the IDs from the embedded links in the RTF field.</p>

<p><strong>IDs</strong></p>

<p>The embedded links in the RTF field take the following form:</p>

<pre><code>https://[someInternalSalesforceURL].force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0Y3l00000G31DT&amp;feoid=00N1N00000F14uz&amp;refid=0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p>There are three IDs in this link:</p>

<ul>
<li>eid: entity ID</li>
<li>feoid: field entity ID</li>
<li>refid: contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to use the eid and the refid to contruct the request to the SF REST API as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>id = eid</li>
<li>contentReferenceId = contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example above:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/fieldName/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Names</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to review your database schema and work out the SObjectName and the fieldName. The SObjectName is the Name of the custom object that contains the RTF field. Say: myObject__c
The fieldName obviously is the name of the RTF field: say myRTFfield__c
The request to SF then works out to be:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/myObject__c/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/myRTFfield__c/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Retrieving the image</strong></p>

<p>Before sending this to SF you need to prefix it with your salesforce instance URL and you need to articulate the REST API version, e.g. v48.0</p>

<p>Sending this as a GET to SF, I am an R user, returns an object that contains the image as data (in the R case: a matrix). This data object can be converted to an image and saved as a PNG file.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You are are authorised by the SF API and received an access token or SessionID and an instance_url.</li>
<li>You have code that sends a query to SF which returns the object with the relevant RTF field.</li>
<li>you have retrieved the embedded link(s) from the RTF field and peeled the eid and refid from the link.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample R code</strong></p>

<p>In R this looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>library(httr)
library(png)

61670491,Userscript: Autofill Sharepoint User list Combobox Filter,"<p>I am trying to autofill an MS Sharepoint form with a userscript/jQuery.
The standard inputs and comboboxes are not an issue using the standard <code>$( selector ).val( value );</code> or clicking an element in the generated list. The issue arises with selecting the user from a dynamic combobox that seems to be a more complex component and not a standard combobox.
This powerapps/appmagic? field dynamically fetches the user list based on a filter value entered into an input field. I have tried setting the input field using <code>.val( value )</code> and <code>.attr( 'value', value )</code> as well as manually filling the span fields displayed when the input is hidden. I have attempted manually triggering the change, keyup, keydown, keypress and input events on the input field and document, but the dynamic list is not populated or displayed to allow me to select an item from it. If I manually add or remove a letter to the filter after my pre-populated value, it works as expected so something behaves differently when I dynamically populate the input field.</p>

<p>Under the DOM inspector, the reactive event seems to be document.input as disabling this stops the population of the combobox under any condition.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with these fields and know how I can dynamically populate this input and have the list generate?</p>

Now on clicking the Next button opens up a template which shows certain questions based on the selected option from the previous template lightning combo-box options.
example if the option is selected as ""30 day Template"" in the first modal box in the second template it will show as shown in the screenshot here,subsequent changes will appear for other options.Please not the Previous button also in this modal box where in clicking it will take us back to the previous page and we can toggle between the two.</p>

<p>Now the problem which is occurring is
Whenever I am trying to select any other value from the lightning combo-box after the first time selection
the second template is populating not only populating the equivalent mapped questions for the one selected in the drop-down,but also the ones which were previously selected.It is appending all the fields mapped for the selected drop-down list which are currently selected as well as previously selected.
<strong>For example</strong>: if in the first modal box I had selected ""30 day Template"" which is mapped to lets say to 3 fields namely <strong>A,B and C</strong> which is displayed in the second modal box once I have click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.Now I decide to go back clicking previous and select a different option lets say 10 day template which is mapped to lets say 4 fields <strong>D,F,G and H</strong> and click on the next button,in the second modal box now it is displaying the fields mapped for the previously selected option i,e. A,B,C as well as the one currently selected D,F,G and H. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>The relevant columns are the <code>Operator</code>, <code>TotalTime</code> and <code>Date</code> (note that the date is stored as <code>varchar(50)</code> because it plays nicer with Microsoft PowerApps that way). </p>

<p>What I need to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aggregate the sum of ""TotalTime"" grouped by Operator</li>
<li>Calculate the time elapsed based on a condition:

<ul>
<li>If between 7AM and 4PM, calculate the time elapsed since 7AM of the current day</li>
<li>If after 4PM, return the total time between 7AM and 4PM of the current day</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Divide the SUM(TotalTime) by the TimeElapsed (AKA the first list item / second list item) in order to get a rough estimate of labor hours worked vs. hours passed in the day. </li>
</ul>

<p>This calculation would change every time the query was ran. This will allow the Microsoft PowerApp that is pulling this query to refresh the efficiency measure in real time. I've taken a stab at it already - see below:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    md.Operator,
    CASE 
       WHEN DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE()) &gt; CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(DATE, DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE()))) + '7:00' AND GETDATE() &lt; CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(DATE, DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE()))) + '15:45' 
          THEN (SUM(isNull(md.TotalTime, 0)) + SUM(isNull(md.DelTime, 0))) * 1.0 / DATEDIFF(MINUTE, CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(DATE, DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE()))) + '7:00' , DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE())) * 100.0
          ELSE (SUM(isNull(md.TotalTime, 0)) + SUM(isNull(md.DelTime, 0))) / 420 * 100.0
    END AS OpEfficiency
FROM 
    [Master Data] AS md
WHERE 
    md.[Date] = CONVERT(varchar(50), DATEADD(HOUR, -5, GETUTCDATE()), 101)
GROUP BY 
    md.Operator
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the <code>DelTime</code> is a different column regarding delay times. I am also converting back from UTC time to avoid any time zone issues when transferring to PowerApps. </p>

<p>However, this is horribly inefficient. I am assuming it is because the <code>Date</code> needs to be converted to datetime every single time. Would it work better if I had a calculated column that already had the date converted? Or is there a better way to calculate time elapsed since a certain time?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>
","<p>There are a few things you can do to increase efficiency considerably. First, you want to make sure SQL can do a simple comparison when selecting rows, so you'll start by calculating a string to match your date on since your [Date] field is a string not a date.</p>

<p>Second, calculate the minutes in your shift (either 540 for a full shift or scaled down to 0 at 7 AM exactly) ahead of time so you aren't calculating minutes in each row.</p>

<p>Third, when summing for operators, use a simple sum on the minutes and calculate efficiency from that sum and your pre-calculated shift so far minutes.</p>

<p>One note - I'm casting the minutes-so-far as FLOAT in my example, maybe not the best type but it's clearer than other decimal types like DECIMAL(18,6) or whatever. Pick something that will show the scale you want.</p>

<p>My example uses a Common Table Expression to generate that date string and minutes-so-far FLOAT, that's nice because it fits in a direct query, view, function, or stored procedure, but you could DECLARE variables instead if you wanted to. </p>

<p>By filtering with an INNER JOIN on the [Date] string against the pre-calculated TargetDate string, I make sure the data set is pared down to the fewest records before doing any math on anything. You'll definitely want to INDEX [Date] to keep this fast as your table fills up.</p>

<p>All these together should give a pretty fast query, good luck </p>

<pre><code>with cteNow as ( --Calculate once, up front - date as string, minutes elapsed as FLOAT (or any non-integer)
    SELECT CASE WHEN 60*DATEPART(HOUR, GETUTCDATE())+DATEPART(MINUTE, GETUTCDATE()) &gt; 60*21

61687572,Does PowerApps Feature support Cross-Site Lookup in SharePoint - Getting Error Creating App from Data,"<p>I am trying to configure some SharePoint lists on the SharePoint Online platform.   These lists are in 2 team sites under the same team collection.    ListA in one site has a lookup column that references ListB on the other site.   Using PowerShell commands, I have been able to successfully setup the cross-site capability and it is working as needed.   </p>

<p>However,  I am now tasked with adding some additional capabilities to the lookup field in ListA,  including filtering of the lookup values listed when users are adding records to ListA.   I had thought to use PowerApps for this.   I am new to PowerApps,  so I have done some simple tests with some a test site &amp; lists to experiment and learn about the PowerApps process.   I was testing using 2 lists in the same site (so lookup was not cross-site).   I was able to create apps using these lists without any problems.</p>

<p>At some point,  I went back to my original setup using cross-site ListA &amp; ListB.   When selected the PowerApps option to create an App for ListA,   I got an error and the App could not be loaded.   </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/acssA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a></p>

<p>I tried a variety of things after that,  including verifying that the lookup field does not allow multiple selections.  I also tried to use the old app that I had used for the test lists (which loaded without error).   In this App, I added an additional connection for a data source to the site containing ListB.   I tried adding an additional column to a local site list,  then using PowerShell to redirect the lookup to the other site.   But nothing has worked.   </p>

<p>At this point,  I am wondering if cross-site lookup is compatible with PowerApps though so far I have not been able to find any forum posts or other online information indicating this.  That is why I am making this post.  Because if PowerApps is not going to work for the functionality that I need to add to ListA,  then I must look at implementing the needed customization another way.</p>

<p>So if anyone has any knowledge about this,  please let me know.   It may be that there is some setting or some other action that I must take before trying to open the PowerApps for my list. </p>

61713625,How to programmatically add a SOAP header based on a generated proxy class,"<p>I'm trying to consume a SOAP webservices provided by a third party. I don't have any control of that webservice. I'm consuming the webservice using a Low Code platform called OutSystems. OutSystems unfortunately doesn't recognize a SOAP header that has to be send with the request so I'll have to add it myself by extending the platform functionality with some custom c# code.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_APIs/SOAP_Extensibility_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOAP Extensibility API</a> gives me access to the WCF ClientCredentials, ServiceEndpoint, IClientChannel and CommunicationState objects. It also provides a method to register an endpoint behavior, using a IEndpointBehavior object.</p>

<p>Using svcutil I've been able to generate proxy classes for the data of the message, including the SOAP header that I should add.</p>

<p>Ideally I'm looking for a way to instantiate an object of the proxy of the header and then somehow pass that to the service. But here is where i'm stuck. I/m not able to find a way to use that object as a SOAP header.</p>

<p>The documentation of OutSytems also provides an example about <a href=""https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/SOAP/Consuming_SOAP_Web_Services/Use_Advanced_Extensibility/Example%3A_Add_SOAP_header"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adding a soap header</a> using .net code. They use MessageHeader.CreateHeader to create a new element with a given element name, namespace and value. So this is also a place where i'm stuck. It would be great if I could use the proxy class here, but this will only allow me to set it as the value. This way I end up with a duplicate 'root' element.</p>

<p>Using the code below:</p>

<pre><code>class AddSoapHeaderMessageInspector : IClientMessageInspector {

    object IClientMessageInspector.BeforeSendRequest(ref Message request, IClientChannel channel) {
        // before sending a request, add a new SOAP header, specifying its name, namespace and value
        request.Headers.Add(MessageHeader.CreateHeader(""MySoapHeader"", ""http://my-namespace.com"", mySOAPHeader));
        return request;
    }

    void IClientMessageInspector.AfterReceiveReply(ref Message reply, object correlationState) {
        // here you would handle the web service response
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would result in XML like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MySoapHeader&gt;&lt;MySoapHeader&gt;&lt;element1&gt;&lt;element2&gt;&lt;/MySoapHeader&gt;&lt;/MySoapHeader&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While it should look like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MySoapHeader&gt;&lt;element1&gt;&lt;element2&gt;&lt;/MySoapHeader&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The solution we have now is one where we've implemented a class that extends MessageHeader. In the OnWriteHeaderContents of that class we manually write the content of the header in code. Unfortunately this is cause some namespace issues at the server side.</p>

<p>I'm posting this on stackoverflow instead of the OutSystems forum because I consider this more of a WCF/C# question than an OutSystems question.</p>

<p><a href=""https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</a></p>

<p>Is it possible for Web App service? If so, can someone please explain how can I achieve this? Thank you!</p>
","<p>I believe your goal as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to access to Web Apps using the URL of <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this, how about this answer? I think that you can achieve your goal using Web Apps. As a sample case, I would like to explain about this using a sample script for downloading a text file, when an user accesses to <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>Please do the following flow.</p>

<h3>1. Create new project of Google Apps Script.</h3>

<p>Sample script of Web Apps is a Google Apps Script. So please create a project of Google Apps Script.</p>

<p>If you want to directly create it, please access to <a href=""https://script.new/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://script.new/</a>. In this case, if you are not logged in Google, the log in screen is opened. So please log in to Google. By this, the script editor of Google Apps Script is opened.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare script.</h3>

<p>Please copy and paste the following script (Google Apps Script) to the script editor. This script is for the Web Apps.</p>

<pre><code>function doGet(e) {
  const path = e.pathInfo;
  if (path == ""filename.txt"") {
    const sampleTextData = ""sample"";
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(sampleTextData).downloadAsFile(path);
  }
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(""Wrong path."");
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>In order to retrieve the value of <code>fileName.txt</code> in <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, please use <code>pathInfo</code>.

<ul>
<li>For example, when you check <code>e</code> of <code>doGet(e)</code> by accessing with <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, you can retrieve <code>{""contextPath"":"""",""contentLength"":-1,""parameter"":{},""parameters"":{},""queryString"":"""",""pathInfo"":""fileName.txt""}</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this case, the GET method is used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Deploy Web Apps.</h3>

<ol>
<li>On the script editor, Open a dialog box by ""Publish"" -> ""Deploy as web app"".</li>
<li>Select <strong>""Me""</strong> for <strong>""Execute the app as:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>By this, the script is run as the owner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select <strong>""Anyone, even anonymous""</strong> for <strong>""Who has access to the app:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>In this case, no access token is required to be request. I think that I recommend this setting for your goal.</li>
<li>Of course, you can also use the access token. At that time, please set this to <strong>""Anyone""</strong>. And please include the scope of <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code> and <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> to the access token. These scopes are required to access to Web Apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click ""Deploy"" button as new ""Project version"".</li>
<li>Automatically open a dialog box of ""Authorization required"".

<ol>
<li>Click ""Review Permissions"".</li>
<li>Select own account.</li>
<li>Click ""Advanced"" at ""This app isn't verified"".</li>
<li>Click ""Go to ### project name ###(unsafe)""</li>
<li>Click ""Allow"" button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Click ""OK"".</li>
<li>Copy the URL of Web Apps. It's like <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec</code>.

<ul>
<li><strong>When you modified the Google Apps Script, please redeploy as new version. By this, the modified script is reflected to Web Apps. Please be careful this.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Run the function using Web Apps.</h3>

<p>Please access to <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec/filename.txt</code> using your browser. By this, a text file is downloaded.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>When you modified the script of Web Apps, please redeploy the Web Apps as new version. By this, the latest script is reflected to the Web Apps. Please be careful this.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Any ideas on what could be causing the Navigate slowness or if the delayed loading warnings are valid (i.e. they are not an artifact of components being new)? The OnVisible of the screens isn't doing much at all.</p>

61776817,Issues Selecting and Setting Values in PowerApps SharePoint Forms,"<p>I'm using PowerApps to create a custom SharePoint Form. </p>

<p>I'm trying to set a submit button that, when clicked, will hopefully do a few things. </p>

<p>First, I want to check if the requested due date is before the next morning at 11 AM. I've had some issues with this and I've had the user pick a date and a time in two separate fields. 
Unfortunately, when I try to reference the 'hour' field, the system throws an error saying I need to compare number data type to number. 
However, in SharePoint this field is a number datatype and on PowerApps the input is set to 'TextFormat.Number'. How would I be able to set this so that it is a number type so I can compare it to a number? Or even better how could I get the user to choose a time that won't require as much strange and foolish new user logic?</p>

<p>The second part of the code is once I check the date, if it is before 11 AM the next day, set a value on the card called Urgent_DataCard1.Value to true. For some reason my app won't let me access the value of this checkbox. I've tried 'Urgent_DataCard1.Value' and 'DataCardValue5' but PowerApps keeps saying it doesn't recognize this reference. How do I correctly reference this value so I can set it correctly on submit?</p>

<p>This is my little code snippet. Thank you for all your assistance.</p>

<p>*Some notes for the code</p>

<p>DatePicker3 is the Date Picker field</p>

<p>DataCardValue17 is the value section of the card ""Request Due Time_DataCard1""</p>

<pre><code>If(
    DatePicker3 &lt; Now()+.5 And DataCardValue17 &gt; 11,

<p>How to sync this update to the SQL Server?</p>

<p>Also, when data changes on the SQL server, how to sync it with the common data service? Is there an out of the box solution?</p>
","<p>Normally we use DES - <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/data-export-service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data export service</a> or Scribe replication to sync data from CDS (Dynamics CRM online) to Azure SQL server. But this is one way data flow, in other words SQL is just a Read-only mirror copy of CDS.</p>

<p>So you have to build the PowerApps (Canvas) to use the CDS connector for reading CDS data and you can update back, so SQL will have latest updated data intact through DES. </p>

<p>If you have two sources, one from CDS and one in SQL separately, then it is your responsibility to build the Master-Slave data sync. Like finding the delta in SQL and update in CDS using some timely jobs or update the CDS and SQL at the same time from PowerApps.</p>

<p>The point of this is to measure ""Right First Time"" for each station. Every time there is a ""Yes"" value in the <code>Pass</code> column, it is a hit to RFT. For example, if there is ten total builds in a given station and five of them have ""Yes"" in the <code>Pass</code> column, that is 50% RFT. </p>

<p>However, this is always giving me a result of '100' for the <code>RFT</code> column. I am adding all these <code>NULLIF</code> and <code>ISNULL</code> caveats because sometimes the <code>Pass</code> column can be null and during some days, there may not be any data at all especially in the mornings. I am assuming that is where the issue lies. Am I not calculating this correctly? I can't think of any other way to not error out or get divide-by-zero errors if I don't include those null checking functions.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>It seems like you want conditional aggregation. I don't get the purpose of the date arithmetics in your existing query, but this would do what you described:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    workstation, 
    avg(case when statys = 'Completed' and pass = 'Yes' then 1.0 else 0 end) rft_rate
from dbs.workstation
group by workstation
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you one record per <code>workstation</code>, with a numeric value between 0 and 1 that represents the rate of records that have value <code>'Yes'</code> in column <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p>Inside the environment there are 2 roles - Admin and maker. Is it environment admin and environment maker? Or is it powerapp admin and powerapp maker?</p>

<p>What permissions does user need to create and use powerapp?</p>
","<p>I know the security role terms are little confusing. Maybe it should read App Maker/admin but again it’s going to confuse Model-driven app makers who need System Admin/customizer roles to do their job. So Environment is right now used to deal with Canvas app and Power Automate (MS Flow) makers. Still Environment May or May not have CDS. </p>

<p>Read it as “Canvas powerapp maker role in current Environment”</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Environment Maker and Environment Admin are the only predefined roles for environments that have no Common Data Service database.</li>
  <li>The Environment Maker role can create resources within an environment, including apps, connections, custom connectors, gateways, and flows using Power Automate. Environment makers can also distribute the apps they build in an environment to other users in your organization. They can share the app with individual users, security groups, or all users in the organization. More information: Share an app in Power Apps</li>
  <li>For users who make apps that connect to the database and need to create or update entities and security roles, you need to assign the System Customizer role in addition to the Environment Maker role. This is necessary because the Environment Maker role doesn't have privileges on the environment's data.</li>
  <li>If the environment has a Common Data Service database, a user must be assigned the System Administrator role instead of the Environment Admin role for full admin privileges, as described in the preceding table.</li>
  </ul>

61840842,Canvas PowerApp Form unable to get fields from Custom Connector returning tabular data from REST API,"<p>I created a <strong>Custom Connector</strong> our of my REST API that returns <strong>tabular data</strong>.

","<p><em>Formally</em>, Collections cannot be used as a DataSource for Form controls in PowerApps. You're efforts are admirable and it looks like you've tried just about everything, so I'll pass my little secret. 
Its probably not officially supported so use at your own risk. </p>

<li>Click the three little dots and <code>Add Custom Card</code></li>
<li>Add a TextBox control to the Custom Card. </li>
<li>Set the TextBox <code>Default</code> property to <code>gallery.Selected.X</code> where ""X"" is the value you want to edit in the form. </li>
<li>Repeat steps 4-7 for each form field you wish to capture. </li>
<li><p>Create a ""Submit"" button in the Form which Patches/UpdateIf's the Collection <strong>then</strong> calls your POST (or PUT) method from the Custom Connector to patch the edits back to your DataSource.</p>

<p>8a. I only see a GET request in your swagger file. You'll (obviously) need a POST/PUT to get the data <em>from</em> the Collection back up <em>to</em> your DataSource. </p>

<p>8b. This little ""wrapper"" is likely what PowerApps handles for you when you use an ""approved"" DataSource for a Form control.</p></li>

","<p>You can use a Combined Text summary field on the parent table to pull all child values into a single comma separated field on the parent table. Since Combined Text fields only work with strings, the Name field should work fine, but for the Record ID you need to first convert that to a string (text) in  a new formula text field on the child table.</p>

61909353,Looping through Excel datasource rows,"<p>I am using Excel table as a data source and I have also added Office365Users data source.</p>

<p>Now, the Excel table looks like this</p>

<pre><code>Name  Age Location

</code></pre>

<p>It is formatted as a table in the Excel so it is a proper data source it is called <code>users</code></p>

<p>What I am trying to do is to use <code>Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName</code> and match it with the name from the Excel row.</p>

<p>So the end result would be that the app would display only my name, age and location rows.</p>

<p>After hours of struggling I haven't gotten anywhere with this, I just cannot figure out how to loop through the ""Users"" table and then match the Name column and display only that row.</p>

<p>If someone could help me or perhaps have a similar example I would be very grateful!</p>
","<p>You can use the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LookUp function</a> to find the row that matches your display name. For example, if you have one label where you would show the user age, you could set its Text property to something like</p>

<pre><code>""Age: "" &amp; LookUp(MyExcelTableName, Name = Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName, Age)
</code></pre>

<p>And similarly to display the location:</p>

<pre><code>""Location: "" &amp; LookUp(MyExcelTableName, Name = Office365Users.MyProfile().DisplayName, Location)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also improve a little the performance of your app by caching the result of the MyProfile() call, and possibly the LookUp as well, so you won't need to make the network call multiple times. For example, in your screen where you have your labels, you can have this expressions in the OnVisible property:</p>

<pre><code>Set(myProfile, Office365Users.MyProfile());
Set(myInfo, LookUp(MyExcelTableName, Name = myProfile.DisplayName))
</code></pre>

<p>And your label texts would become</p>

<pre><code>""Age: "" &amp; myInfo.Age
""Location: "" &amp; myInfo.Location

61961302,How To Add Zoho CRM Leads with the Zoho CRM v2 API,"<p>How do I add a Zoho CRM Lead with the Zoho CRM v2 API, using simple curl connections? The docs are not very clear on not only how to add a lead, but how to even get the proper oAuth token to create the lead.</p>
","<p><a href=""https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/insert-records.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The docs</a> are not very clear on this process. So, I'll simplify this. The biggest hurdle are the steps to get the refresh token. Once you have that, you can generate countless access tokens that are used to make the actual API calls.</p>

<h1>How To Get Your Refresh Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Login to your Zoho CRM <em>with an admin-level account</em> and have that open in a tab. Then, in another browser tab, login into the Developer API Console: <a href=""https://api-console.zoho.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://api-console.zoho.com/</a></li>
<li>In the Developer API Console, you need to create a Server-Side Client. The fields should be populated like so: <strong>Client Name</strong> (any logical name you want), <strong>Homepage URL</strong> (the homepage of the domain where you're going to be making the API calls, or just use the same URL for where you're doing the redirects), <strong>Authorized Redirect URIs</strong> (put a web page up on the domain where you're going to make the API call and make it emit nothing more than ""zoho confirmed""). (The ""zoho confirmed"" is not required and not mentioned in the docs, but does help you understand the process better.) Click Create.</li>
<li>Once created, click on it again and there's a tab called Client Secret. Click it and record in a notepad your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>.</li>
<li>Take a URL encoder script online (or use PHP or any other tool) and URL encode the following parameters for a new URL you need to compose and load in your browser in the next step:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>scope: ZohoCRM.modules.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.ALL,ZohoCRM.users.ALL,ZohoCRM.org.ALL,aaaserver.profile.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.functions.all,ZohoCRM.notifications.all,ZohoCRM.coql.read,ZohoCRM.files.create,ZohoCRM.bulk.all
response_type: code
access_type: offline
client_id: {use the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {use the Authorized Redirect URI you generated in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>With those URL encoded parameters, pass them to the end of this URL in your browser: <code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?</code> Thus, you would have something similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.ALL%2CZohoCRM.users.ALL%2CZohoCRM.org.ALL%2Caaaserver.profile.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.functions.all%2CZohoCRM.notifications.all%2CZohoCRM.coql.read%2CZohoCRM.files.create%2CZohoCRM.bulk.all&amp;client_id=1000.TTT0BSTTTC9TTTRILR3MGXBYAC82LH&amp;response_type=code&amp;access_type=offline&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%3Azohoconfirm
</code></pre>

<p><em>Please note that if your redirect URI (like <a href=""https://example.com/zohoconfirm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://example.com/zohoconfirm</a>, above) does another redirection with like a 301 or 302 redirect and doesn't also forward those query parameters, then you'll lose the parameters you need to see when finished.</em></p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>Once you load that in your browser, you will see an Accept button. If you do not, then you may have missed that in step 1 you were supposed to login to the CRM in one tab, and then open a new tab to do other tasks. That makes a session open for you and it knows who you are when doing step 5.</p></li>
<li><p>After you click the Accept button, Zoho's account system will redirect you to your Authorized Redirect URI that you specified. So, if you followed these steps exactly, you should see some output like ""zoho confirmed"". But do not close the tab. Look at the URL of the tab and cut/paste it into your notepad. In there, grab that <strong>code</strong> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you have that code parameter, you need to create a special Curl POST request. You can do this either via command line or with your favorite programming language. From command line on Linux, this would look something like the following:</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=1000.aaa1f9aa8582eaaaafeaddfaf0f3b6b.bf7fe646ba899783501c21a9a3240aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fzohoconfirm""
</code></pre>

<p>The URL-encoded parameters you need to fill out are:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: authorization_code
code: {the code you recorded from step 7}
client_id: {the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
client_secret: {the Client Secret you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {the Authorized Redirect URI you recorded in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""9"">
<li>Once you run that Curl command, it will return some JSON that looks similar to the following:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaaa5579abeea73871b096c941ec1df8.7835dbb43bbf5122f2d5810f0b65aaa"",""refresh_token"":""1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""10"">
<li>Now, in the JSON output, you <em>could</em> use that <strong>access_token</strong> to make an API call to generate the lead, but you're better off just taking that <strong>refresh_token</strong> and putting that in a configuration file for later use in your programming. According to their documentation, their refresh_token lasts forever. You should keep this in an extremely secure place.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Get Your Access Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Now that you get your <strong>refresh_token</strong>, you use it to generate a fresh <strong>access_token</strong> each time you need to make an API call. To do that, make another Curl POST with a URL similar to below. In Linux command line with Curl, as an example, here's what it would look like:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=refresh_token&amp;refresh_token=1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa""
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an explanation of how to do the URL-encoded parameters:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: refresh_token
refresh_token: {use the refresh_token (the one I said that would last forever) from your stored config file from step 10 in the previous steps}
client_id: {use your client_id}
client_secret: {use your client_secret} 
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Running the above command should return to you some JSON that looks similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaa1c95788b34226c2844a841bfd1d5.6aff70f4adbc3fee9e6b57579e481aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be storing that <strong>access_token</strong> you received in a temporary variable so that you can make an API call to do something like add a Zoho CRM Lead. That access token will last 3600 seconds (1 hour), but really is of no consequence because you can generate infinite access tokens since you have that refresh_token stored in a configuration file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Create A Zoho CRM Lead</h1>

<ol>
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be using that refresh token to create an access token, and then using it for the following header to pass in your API call:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken XXXXXX
</code></pre>

<p>...where XXXXXX is the access_token you received from the previous set of instructions.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Here's a sample in PHP with file_get_contents (although you can do the same with PHP's Curl) to make a request to add a Zoho CRM Lead. You can take the following example and recode it in your favorite programming language. Change the $sAccessToken value to the one you generated. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note, below, we're also writing into a field called ""Lead Source"", and it's API-accessible name is ""Lead_Source"". (If you end up changing the code below to write into Contacts or Accounts, then you'll want to create a custom field, I'm sure, to indicate where the contact or account came from. For instance, if you have a shopping cart, then you could indicate the record came from completing that transaction, rather than a customer calling in.)</p>

<p>To understand where to find the API-addressable field names, in your CRM, go to: Setup > Developer Space > APIs > API Names > Leads. Choose ""Fields"" from the ""Filter By"" drop-down.</p>

<p>Note that this API does not look for duplicates. You can adapt the above to do an ""upsert"" instead of an ""insert"": <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html</a></p>

<p>Each row is a project and each column is a day/date from the week.
The user will be able to choose a calendar week.
Based on the chosen calendar week each column should change it`s header to the dates in this week.
e.g If CW 1 2020 => First column should change to 30.12.2019, second column to 31.12.2019, etc.</p>

<p>Basically what I need is formula that will get the CW and the weekday num (e.g CW 1, weekday 1) and calculate the date.</p>

<p>Google App Maker has a Multi Select Widget which allows the user to select several options from a list. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uaWbv.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uaWbv.gif"" alt=""Multi Select Widget with &#39;Suppliers&#39; heading""></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Current State</em></strong></p>

<p>By default, all options are unselected and the user must manually select all desired options. </p>

<p><strong><em>Desired State</em></strong></p>

<p>I would like to programatically cause all options to be selected so that the user can manually deselect all undesired options.</p>

<p><strong><em>What I've Tried</em></strong></p>

<p><em>App Maker Documentation:</em></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/input-widgets#multi-select"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Multi Select Widget documentation</a> provides information about how to bind options and values, but does not provide an option for pre-selecting these options.</p>

<p><em>Javascript onAttach Event and onDataLoad Event:</em></p>

<p>I attempted to run Javascript to programatically select the options but think this is where I'm coming undone. </p>

<p>The options in my Multi Select Widget are bound to <code>@datasources.Suppliers.items..Supplier_Name</code> and all options are displayed in the widget correctly.</p>

<p>I can successfully hard-code the options to be programatically selected, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var optionsToBeProgramaticallySelected = [""Option1"", ""Option2"", ""Option3""];
widget.values = optionsToBeProgramaticallySelected;
</code></pre>

<p>... however, I do not want to hard-code the values to be selected because these will change over time. Therefore, I attempted to programatically create an array of all options and use <em>that</em> as the list of options to be programatically selected. However, I was not able to successfully return the array for use. The code I used to attempt this is:  </p>

<pre><code>var listOfAllPossibleOptions = app.datasources.Suppliers.items.concat();
widget.values = listOfAllPossibleOptions;
</code></pre>
