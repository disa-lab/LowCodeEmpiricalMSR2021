It makes 90% of a project extremely easy; it takes the advantages of an ORM but integrates it beautifully into the development system, the lifecycle is great on a project. I like the deployment/versioning/rollback story. Anything that falls outside of its realm is very easy to handle in Visual Studio using the Integration Studio.</p>

<p>I've found a couple of minor bugs along the way, but I have to say that the support team has been EXTREMELY responsive to them, even though I am an unpaying, ""Community Edition"" member. The support in the forums, both from OutSystems and from the other users has been outstanding.</p>

<p>The ONLY hitch that I've found, is that it currently is no compatible with .NET 4 and Visual Studip 2008. I've been told that it is on the roadmap. If you have code that <em>must</em> use .NET 4 before they get that support in, you can easily wrap it in a WCF service and import that service directly in Service Studio. This is what I did, and it turned out to be a big benefit since the .NET 4 code was very resource intensive so I now have some scalability options.</p>

<p>Every development tool/language/stack/... involves some tradeoffs at some point.

There may be a way to use several Perlin noise systems at different scales to make lightning, but perhaps one of these other methods would work better:</p>

<p>The midpoint displacement method is a very fast algorithm
for generating shapes that look a lot like lightning.
Alas, it only generates a (very jagged) lines between two points, never forks.

<p>If you would like to use the CRM as a backend for a calendar, you may want to write a ""Provider"" type extension, similar to the Provider for Google Calendar. You just need to implement a few methods for the usual operations (get/add/modify/delete) to get started. See the <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/calendar/providers/gdata/"" rel=""nofollow"">source code for the Provider for Google Calendar</a> as a starting point.</p>

<p>If you would just like to do a one time import, then you are probably going in the right direction. Just use the addItem/adoptIte method on the calendar in question. If you need a dialog to select calendars, you can <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/calendar/base/content/dialogs/chooseCalendarDialog.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">reuse this one</a>, it is available via the uri chrome://calendar/content/chooseCalendarDialog.xul.</p>

<p>Now to get to your real question. To add a reminder to an event or todo the following code helps. Of course you can choose a different alarm relation.</p>

<pre><code>Components.utils.import(""resource://calendar/modules/calUtils.jsm"");

let todo = cal.createToDo();
let alarm = cal.createAlarm();
let alarmDate = cal.createDateTime();

alarm.related = Components.interfaces.calIAlarm.ALARM_RELATED_ABSOLUTE;
alarm.alarmDate = alarmDate;

todo.addAlarm(alarm);
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>The alarm implements calIAlarm, you can find the <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/calendar/base/public/calIAlarm.idl"" rel=""nofollow"">interface description here</a>. It is then added to the todo, which implements calITodo and also calIItemBase. For an overview of the alarm methods on an item, <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/calendar/base/public/calIItemBase.idl#154"" rel=""nofollow"">see here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested what other utility functions are available, <a href=""http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/find?string=calUtils.js&amp;tree=comm-central"" rel=""nofollow"">see here</a>. You can use functions from both files by merely importing calUtils.<strong>jsm</strong>. Just prefix each function with ""cal."".</p>

<p>To elaborate more on your example below, there are a few syntax errors and you might need different flags. I'm not sure why the alert is needed, that sounds to me like the event loop is not being spun. In what context are you calling these bits?</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>var arrayItems = new Array();

<p>So here what I code :</p>

<pre><code>var arrayItem = new Array; ;

    var todoListener =

        onOperationComplete: function(aCalendar, aStatus, aOperationType, aId, aDetail) {},

    };

    var filter = aCalendar.ITEM_FILTER_ALL_ITEMS;
    filter |= aCalendar.ITEM_FILTER_TYPE_TODO;
    aCalendar.getItems(filter, 0, null, null, todoListener);
</code></pre>

<p>However, I have a really weird issue here. Actually, I do not get the todos with this code. I have to add an <code>alert(""something"");</code> after the getItems() method to get my arrayItem filled up. Else, it is empty.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the metadata API to get all of the Profile objects and parse for loginIPRanges. You can use Apache ANT and the Force.com migration tool commands to do this. You can also get the SecuritySettings from the same API and method and get a lot of the things in the Security Health Check, if you need them. The results will be returned in XML, which you can easily parse in your python script.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the API and a SOQL query to check for the isMobileUser permission, use python to parse/output results. Beatbox is a good library for connecting to the standard API.</p></li>
<li><p>For the last two, I think you'll need to go with some screen scraping/browser automation and parsing.

<p>Ideally you'll be able to combine these into one large script that fires off beatbox, then fires off ant/migration tool, and some browser automation script. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, actions originating from the final approval step in an approval process do not further trigger other actions. For example, if you were to have an email alert go out when a checkbox is checked, the email won't go out if the checkbox is checked by finishing an approval process.</p>

<p>The only way around this, that I've found, is to have the actions of your approval process trigger an asynchronous method which, in turn, updates the field connected to your milestone.
Separating the processes from the approval process itself, by having it call an @future method, ensures regular workflow rules are followed.</p>

Normally, the provider also issues a confidential <em>client secret</em> that is additionally included into the <em>access token</em> request, so the provider can verify that your app is allowed to use that <em>client id</em>.</p>

<p>Chrome extensions run on an open platform and the platform itself provides no methods for either authenticating the extension against a server (which salesforce would then also have to support) or storing properties securely (would be hard, if not impossible on an open platform), so keeping the <em>client secret</em> confidential is unfortunately not possible.</p>

<p>As this is a common problem, it is already considered in the OAuth specification (see <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">section 10.1 Client Authentication</a> and <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10.2 Client Impersonation</a>). The provider is therefore required to do additional checks, but on the client side you can't do anything to effectively improve security.</p>

<p>The important part that you are missing is the authentication call to get the 'ticket'. Supplying the application token is not enough to do a DoQuery call. You must authenticate and then use the ticket that is sent back to do any more API calls. For a url request, the ticket can be appended quite easily <code>&amp;ticket=randomcharacters</code>.

    class MyApplication
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            var application = client.Connect(""your_app_dbid"", ""your_app_token"");
            var table = application.GetTable(""your_table_dbid"");
            table.Query();

            foreach(var record in table.Records)
            {
               Console.WriteLine(record[""your_column_heading""]);
            }
            client.Logout();
        }
    }

</code></pre>

<p>To do specific query using the already built C# API, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var querystring1 = new QueryStrings(FieldID,ComparisonOperator.GTE,value,LogicalOperator.AND);
var querystring2 = new QueryStrings(FieldID, ComparisonOperator.XEX, value, LogicalOperator.NONE);
</code></pre>

<p>then </p>

<pre><code>    var query = new Query();
query.Add(querystring1);
query.Add(querystring2);
table.Query(query, new[] { 1,2,3,4}, new[] { 1,2});
</code></pre>

<p>The second parameter is the field IDs of the columns you want and the Third parameter is the field ID's to sort the records by.</p>

<p>In your case I would just do the loop and add all the records to a collection. Then you could probably use LINQ or just the column headings to loop through all your records.</p>

<p>This is the way I did it to get specific data:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var record in table.Records)
            {
                var row = new String[8];
                row[0] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[1] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[2] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[3] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[4] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[5] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[6] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[7] = record[""Column Name""];

12155164,2,,3016015,2012-08-28T08:09:03.410,,33,,"<p>I used Outsytems for a while due to company's new direction.</p>

<p>So far I found out that Outsytems is quite good in assisting even the newest/dullest programmers with developing a clean and maintainable data layers as well as readable logic. Even creating workflow is a breeze if you keep it within OutSystem.</p>

<p>TLDR: even the 'most newbiest' programmer can create a decent application using Outsystems. </p>

<p><strong>User interface</strong></p>

<p>One hiccup I have encountered so far is when we want to create a rather complex user interface (javascript plugins etc) that looks very different from Intelliwrap template. </p>

<p>Just like in any IT sales talk, ""It can be done!"" - it can always be done - but expect a lot of trial and error. The behaviors of javascript, css and such can be unpredictable at times - especially if you try to override most of the interface portion of the Outsystems.</p>

<p>Note that there are not many tutorial / forum post that discuss user interface aspect of Outsystems throughly since it is indeed difficult and in most aspect quite annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Automated test</strong></p>

<p>Another aspect that bother me is that the difficulty of creating a test driven development environment. In most cases, automated testing environment is almost impossible to set up. </p>

<p>Yes there are plugins and such but expect no support or whatsoever to set it up. Nuno from Outsystems has kindly showed me how Outsystems use automated testing tools on their platform development. However, this portion is not for everyone as it is very difficult to set up. Be prepared to do manual testing when doing development using Outsystems (e.g. hire lots of interns)</p>

<p>In our case, the problem of setting up testing tool is amplified since we are not using inteliwarp and default Outsystems UI component. </p>

<p>Doing agile development without automated testing is a bit weird - similar to visiting McDonalds that does not offer fries. </p>

<p><strong>Talent shortage</strong></p>

<p>Another issue that you might encounter when dealing with Outsystems will be possible bottlenecks due to limited supply of people with required skills. </p>

<p>Outsystems staff will help you as much as they can but when it comes to some kind of exotic integration with other systems or doing your own hacking (e.g. UI/database/etc) be prepared to be on your own. Google or Stackoverflow will not be of much help. As per today, only fewer than 20 questions are tagged with 'Outsystems' in Stack Overflow. Forget to find sample in Github.</p>

<p>You can always go to their community site which is quite active. However, be prepared to be on your own when you want to do something more than just standard Outsystems application. </p>

<p>In some cases, expert developers might find using Outsystems studio is nothing short of <em>insulting</em> and does not contribute much to their personal career development (e.g. limited job opportunities, depreciating original skills). </p>

<p>No matter what, you will almost never be able to find developer who can jump into the team doing Outsystems project immediately without prior training. This problem will be amplified if you plan to do a lot of modification and custom development.</p>

<p><strong>Version control</strong></p>

<p>Outsystems platform is bundled with its own <em>code repository / version control</em> mechanism but do not expect something like SVN or GIT. To be fair it is good enough for most cases but merging. The merging action is done at the file/component level. Outsystems can only detect if the file/component has been changed. The merging mechanism is essentially overwriting the entire file. No such thing as line-by-line code comparison/insertion/deletion (there is no code anyway).</p>

<p>Reverting to the older version of your work can be quite troublesome imho.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation / knowledge sharing</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your company culture, documenting or sharing best practice / cookbook / step-by-step instruction might be a bit hard due to the need of capturing screenshots all the time. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>
If you just want to create simple CRUD systems with standard UI, just like any enterprise application, Outsystems will do its job well - very well indeed. Just do not expect too much of bell and whistles and remember: any custom development and alteration to the default framework will cost you (or your developer) dearly.</p>

m=document.getElementById('myTooltip');
if((y&gt;10)&amp;&amp;(y&lt;450))
{  m.style.top=y-4+""px"";  }
else{  m.style.top=y+4+""px"";  }
var messageHeigth=(message.length/20)*10+25;
if((e.clientY+messageHeigth)&gt;510)
{  m.style.top=y-messageHeigth+""px""; }
if(x&lt;850) { m.style.left=x+20+""px"";  }
else{  m.style.left=x-170+""px"";  }
m.innerHTML=message;m.style.display=""block"";m.style.zIndex=203;
}

function hidetip(){
var m;
m=document.getElementById('myTooltip');m.style.display=""none"";
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
#myTooltip{padding: 5px; background-color: #FFF8DC;  border: 1px solid #DEB887; width:180px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #6b6b6b; display:none; position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the HTML (will have an extra DIV below the href to show tooltip):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""javascript:void(0)"" onmouseover=""showtip(event, 'Sample tooltip text');""
onmouseout=""hidetip();""&gt;Hover mouse to see tooltip text.&lt;/a&gt;

The extension code maps to .NET / Java code and the underlying calls to the regex methods are <code>Replace(string input, string replacement)</code> for .NET and <code>replaceAll(String replacement)</code> for Java. These will both replace all occurrences of your regexp on the given input string.</p>

<p>Now, several ways into solving your problem...</p>

<p><strong>If you want to replace in the beginning of the string:</strong>
In the example you've given, the <em>hello</em> you're interested in removing is also in the beginning of the input string. In that particular case you could use a regular expression such as <code>^hello</code>.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to replace the first match, anywhere in the string:</strong>
If you're interested in replacing the first occurrence but that can be anywhere in the input string, then you could write an expression such as <code>hello(.*)</code> and use as replacement string <code>$1</code>. In this case, <code>$1</code> would mean the capturing group <code>(.*)</code> which would include all further occurrences of <em>hello</em>. This works both for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ewy2t5e0.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET</a> and <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#appendReplacement%28java.lang.StringBuffer,%20java.lang.String%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Java</a>. Of course this way of doing things is neither pretty nor efficient so...</p>

<p><strong>If you want to have more regex capabilities:</strong> you can use Integration Studio to download and open the Text extension and add any new methods that you want, although since this extension is included in the platform and can be replaced by an upgrade, I'd suggest creating your own extension and using the Text extension as a template. You could create an extension action very similar to the current <code>Replace</code> one but that could take an additional <em>count</em> parameter or something similar.</p>

16933757,2,,16930202,2013-06-05T07:16:33.960,,2,,"<p>Best would be to create separate set of buttons as it's less redirects...</p>

<p>If you want to really override standard ones I think you'll have to use normal overrides (on all buttons) but with content based on Javascript you'd be deciding what should happen.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_console/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_console/index.htm</a> - Console JS API will be handy.</p>

<p>Make a visualforce page that uses <code>standardController=""Your_Object__c""</code>. In the content include a reference to the Console API and code similar to this example of <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_console/Content/sforce_api_console_settabtitle.htm"" rel=""nofollow""><code>isInConsole()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;apex:includeScript value=""/support/console/27.0/integration.js""/&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function testIsInConsole() {
        if (sforce.console.isInConsole()) {
              alert(""in console"");
           } else {
              alert(""not in console"");
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Except you'll be redirecting either to your special pages or to standard ""new"" and ""edit"". To force going to original edit mode you can add <code>nooverride=1</code> parameter in the URL (which is also mentioned in the documentation of <a href=""https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=customize_functions_i_z.htm&amp;language=en_US#URLFOR"" rel=""nofollow""><code>URLFOR</code></a> function).</p>

<p>Normal ""new Account"" (results in override if specified): <code>/001/e</code></p>

<p>Force go to your page: <code>/apex/NewAccount</code></p>

<p>Force go to standard page: <code>/001/e?nooverride=1</code></p>

<p>So now you have an idea how to detect whether you're in console or not and where to go. Only remaining question is ""which window should redirect"". Because Console is built on frames you might get different results on using javascript window, location, parent etc. objects.  That's a general knowledge how to work with frames in JS so I'm not going to write that up. But I'll include a link to <a href=""http://blogs.salesforce.com/product/2013/05/the-service-cloud-console-working-with-buttons-and-links.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>srcUp()</code></a> function provided by salesforce that you might want to reuse. </p>

<p>I think it's defined only in Console context to be honest so maybe you could ditch the whole <code>isInConsole</code> in favor of <code>typeof srcUp != 'undefined'</code>?</p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>

18376080,2,,18335697,2013-08-22T09:10:05.233,,26,,"<p>I'm having the same problem with connection timeouts. It seems to me that there are issues around SSL sockets in the default Django SMTP library. In the development version of Django there is an option to set <code>EMAIL_USE_SSL = True</code> which allows for the use of an <em>implicit</em> TLS connection (as opposed to <em>explicit</em>, which is specified by <code>EMAIL_USE_TLS = True</code>). Generally the former (implicit) uses port 465, while the latter (explicit) uses port 587. See the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#email-use-ssl"">Django docs</a> -- compare the development version with version 1.5. Note that the option <code>EMAIL_USE_SSL</code> is NOT present in 1.5.</p>

<p>Thus, the problem is that <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/faq/imap-access1.html#f2a2"">Zoho's default SMTP server uses port 465 and requires SSL</a>, but the <code>EMAIL_USE_TLS</code> option doesn't fulfill this requirement. (Side note: maybe try setting this option to <code>False</code>? I didn't try that.) Anyway, my best guess is that this is a Django-specific issue and may not be solved until 1.7.</p>

<p>As for a solution to your problem: you can definitely access Zoho's SMTP server with Python (2.7.1)'s <code>smtplib</code> (see script below). So, if you want a slightly inelegant fix, you could go that route. I've tested this in Django 1.5.1 and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>Here's the stand-alone Python script (which can be adapted for use in a Django project):</p>

<pre><code>import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# Define to/from
sender = 'sender@example.com'
recipient = 'recipient@example.com'

# Create message
msg = MIMEText(""Message text"")
msg['Subject'] = ""Sent from python""
msg['From'] = sender
msg['To'] = recipient

# Create server object with SSL option
server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.zoho.com', 465)

# Perform operations via server
server.login('sender@example.com', 'password')
server.sendmail(sender, [recipient], msg.as_string())
server.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Try checking that the above script runs with your Zoho credentials before plugging it into your web project. Good luck!</p>

<ol>
<li>Stop the poller when edit mode or making changes also blocking the record for editing so no one else could overwrite your changes.</li>
<li>Split the viewState into two separate ViewStates, one is going to load records, second one is going to be used for editing selected record, when saved first ViewState is going to be refreshed with last changes made on second ViewState, you can accomplish this by using multiple forms and a syncing mechanism.</li>

About three years ago, I start a similar Google Maps integration project for SugarCRM. The JJWDesign Google Maps project is up on GitHub.com. The idea came about during a marketing meeting and quickly grew out of control.</p>

<p>Download at:
<a href=""https://github.com/jjwdesign/JJWDesign-Google-Maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jjwdesign/JJWDesign-Google-Maps</a></p>

<p>Here are some of the pitfalls that I've experienced:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exceeding Limits of Geocoding: The Google Maps API v3 has in place a limit of 2,500 Geocoding requests per day. It is also throttled to 10 per second. So, you'll most likely need to develop something to queue these requests. I used a CRON/Scheduled Task to handle the processing trigger.</li>
<li>PHP Memory Limits: The design of SugarCRM creates rather large objects for each one of it's records. Using 10,000 of these objects will usually exceed the memory allowed for PHP to execute. So, special consideration may be needed in examining the best way to pull data into the map.</li>
<li>Always develop/test with a large data set; 10,000+ records. This way you'll be able to more easily see inefficiencies in your code; especially JavaScript. The IE Browser has been know to cause issues with MarkerClustering.</li>
<li>Get ready for an explosion of interest in advanced search / filtering functionality. Also, expect to develop a large section of Admin configuration. Everyone wants something slightly different.</li>

In the controller, use SOQL to run a query for all Contacts and save the result to a list or map. You can then use this variable to pass the Contact data to the visualforce page. If you just want to dump the data to the page as HTML then you can use a list variable to hold the query result and an apex:repeat tag to generate the HTML on the visualforce page. If you want more control over how the data is displayed then you could also use the apex variable to pass the data to a javascript variable which you could then build your HTML from client-side in whatever way you like.</p>

<p>More detail would be needed to give you full steps on how to set this all up exactly how you want but basically you should use a visualforce page to give them an interface to run your apex code from. Access to that page can be controlled via profiles or permission sets.</p>

<p>First, create a function that you can call from anywhere (e.g. when a new sub-form record is added or changed)--for details on that, go here: <a href=""http://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/functions.html</a></p>

<p>This function will first duplicate the sub-form records by the parent record ID (sorting by the appropriate column) and then delete all sub-form records that were inserted before the script started:</p>

<pre><code>int SubFormRecords_SortByAnything_ReturnCount(int ParentRecordID)
{
    scriptStartTime = zoho.currenttime;
    for each rSubFormRecord in SubFormRecords  [ParentFieldName = input.ParentRecordID] sort by FieldName1, FieldName3, FieldName2
    {
        NewSubFormRecordID = insert into SubFormRecords
        [
            FieldName1 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName1
            FieldName2 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName2
            FieldName3 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName3
        ];
    }
    delete from SubFormRecords[ (Series == input.ParentRecordID &amp;&amp; Added_Time &lt; scriptStartTime) ];
    return SubFormRecords[ParentFieldName == input.EventID].count();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the above sorting function is in place (customized for your application), call it when appropriate.  I call it when adding a record associated with the sub-form, or when I change the sorting column values.</p>

<p>That works well, and as long as you don't have complex logic associated with adding and deleting records, it should have minimal impact on application performance.</p>

<p>Please let me know whether that works for you, and if you have any better ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> This solution is not suitable for forms containing additional sub-form records because deleting the records will delete linked sub-form values.</p>

<p><strong>1) ExtractVariables Policy</strong></p>

<p>If your inbound payload looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{‚ÄúXMLDATA‚Äù:‚Äù&lt;GeteBayOfficialTimeRequest xmlns=""urn:ebay:apis:eBLBaseComponents""&gt;...}
</code></pre>

<p>Then do a JSON extraction like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;JSONPayload&gt;
    &lt;Variable name=""xmldata""&gt;
        &lt;JSONPath&gt;$.XMLDATA&lt;/JSONPath&gt;
    &lt;/Variable&gt;
&lt;/JSONPayload&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will only work if the Content-Type of your request is application/json (if you want to force it, do an AssignMessage policy just before it and </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Set&gt;
  &lt;Headers&gt;
    &lt;Header name=""Content-type""&gt;application/json&lt;/Header&gt;
  &lt;/Headers&gt;
&lt;/Set&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2) AssignMessage Policy to create new POST payload</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have a variable named xmldata you can create a new request message with an AssignMessage policy like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;Payload contentType=""text/xml""&gt;
    &amp;lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;GeteBayOfficialTimeRequest xmlns=""{xmldata}""&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;RequesterCredentials&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;eBayAuthToken&amp;gt;
    &lt;/Payload&gt;
  &lt;/Set&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you have to escape the &lt; and > in the Payload XML (otherwise Apigee tries to parse it as configuration XML) and note that {xmldata} variable in curlybraces. </p>

<p>Here are the links to the documentation on Apigee if you need more details about the policies:</p>

<li>Create a <a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/platform_connect/index_Left.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Canvas App</a> in Salesforce that will surface your ASP.NET site in an iframe. Salesforce will POST a signed request to your ASP.NET site that you can use to verify the request came from Salesforce and get a valid Session ID for making calls back into Salesforce via the API.</li>
<li>Create a <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Single_Sign_On_for_Composite_Apps"" rel=""nofollow"">Composite App</a>. This is the older version of a Canvas App. Again, your ASP.NET site will appear in an iframe. Here the Salesforce SessionId and orginating Server URL are passed on the query string.</li>

24618115,2,,24617605,2014-07-07T19:13:56.483,,0,,"<p>When working with mustache js templates (or js templates in general), you do not need to have the template be in the same location as the data being returned from the ajax call. However, you will need to have the data stored in a var that is within scope of the render function of the template. I am assuming you wish to ajax in a set of data, parse it to JSON, then at some point render that JSON data to the DOM. So to answer your questions:</p>

<p>1) Does the template need to be contained in the page that the JSON data is?
 Not necessarily, but you will need to be able to access both parts from one locations (ie, you would ajax in both the template and the data, then put it together. Alternatively, you could store the template in the DOM as a script [recommended way unless you are using AMD], and then render the template when your ajax call is complete). </p>

<p>The main thing to note is you will need to have a reference to both your template and your data in the same scope.</p>

<p>2) Setting up the template / data ?</p>

<p>This can be done by using the ajax success callback: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest</a></p>

<p>So on success, you can have the function call render on your template, or just set a locally scoped variable with the data and handle the template rendering after. </p>

<p>3) render the template normally</p>

<pre><code>var template = $('#template').html(), //script tage with id=""template"" from your dom
    data = jsonData, //saved somewhere in a local scoped var .. maybe from an ajax call
    rendered = Mustache.render(template, data),
    target = $(""#target""); //where the template renders to

$('#target').html(rendered);
</code></pre>

<p>4) render the template via $.ajax</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax(""/api/data"", function(data){
    var jsonData = $.parseJSON(data),
        template = $('#template').html(), //script tage with id=""template"" from your dom
        rendered = Mustache.render(template, jsonData),
        target = $(""#target""); //where the template renders to

27671626,2,,27671054,2014-12-27T21:30:07.357,,0,,"<p>You are transforming the normals. But at least for part of the lighting calculations, you're using a light source position that is also transformed into the same coordinate space. If you transform both the normals <strong>and</strong> the light source, the direction of the normals relative to the light source will be the same again.</p>

<p>Extracting the key lines from the vertex shader:</p>

<pre><code>    position=vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix*gl_Vertex);
    lightPos2 = vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix*vec4(lightPos,1.0));
    normal=gl_NormalMatrix*gl_Normal;
</code></pre>

<p><code>gl_NormalMatrix</code> corresponds to <code>gl_ModelViewMatrix</code>, with the necessary adjustments to transform direction vectors instead of points. Therefore, the modelview transformation has been applied to all of <code>position</code>, <code>lightPos2</code> and <code>normal</code>.</p>

<p>Then, all three of these values (with interpolation applied) are passed into the fragment shader, where you have this calculation for the diffuse lighting term:</p>

<pre><code>    vec3 surf2light=normalize(position-lightPos2);
    float dcont=max(0.0, 
                dot( normalize(nMat*(-normal)), nMat*surf2light) );
    vec3 diffuse=dcont*(TexColor.rgb*ldiffuse);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there's a couple of issues here:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're applying <code>nMat</code>, which is the normal matrix, to both vectors again, even though they were already transformed. It does no harm, since the dot product does not change if you apply the same rotation to both vectors, but it does not make sense.</li>
<li>All the values used (<code>position</code>, <code>lightPos2</code>, <code>normal</code>) were transformed by the modelview matrix. So their relative positions/directions are exactly the same as they were originally. The result of the calculation will be the same as it would be if it were applied to the corresponding untransformed vectors.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to decide which coordinate system you want to use for the lighting calculations. There are at least a couple of options. The easiest one for you is probably to use eye coordinate space. To do this, you can apply the view transformation to the light position before passing it into the shader, and then use this light position directly, without any additional transformations, in the shader code.</p>

<p>Since you say that the specular lighting works as desired, and you're using the uniform <code>lightPos</code> there, it might be as simple as using that variable instead of <code>lightPos2</code> in the diffuse calculation.</p>

For that you can use on the salesforce side Outbound Messaging and a Workflow rule.

Your webservice endpoint will be queuing these messages to a common messaging queue used by your Sync Service.

<pre><code>type RecWithContent rs = Content ‚àà rs =&gt; Rec Attrs rs

getContent' :: RecWithContent rs -&gt; LanguageContent
</code></pre>

<p>This is really just wrapping up the constraint in a type synonym. You need <code>RankNTypes</code> and probably a bunch of other extensions.</p>

<p>Your existing attempts to solve the problem and leave just <code>a</code> on the right hand side of the <code>=&gt;</code> boil down to this type synonym:</p>

<pre><code>type HasContent c = (Content ‚àà fs, c ~ Rec Attr fs)
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you want <code>HasContent</code> to witness two separate things: that <code>Content</code> is in <code>fs</code>, and that the type parameter <code>c</code> is equal to <code>Rec Attr fs</code>.</p>

<p>I don't think you can do this in a way that's convenient for you. With the type synonym, the surface-level problem is that <code>rs</code> is not in scope on the right hand side. The deeper issue is that you're asking the compiler to make up <code>fs</code>; you want to write something like <code>exists fs. (Content ‚àà fs, c ~ Rec Attr fs)</code>, which is not expressible directly in current Haskell.</p>

<p>Your type family solution won't help, but for a different reason. In the definition of <code>getContent</code>, the compiler needs proof that <code>a</code> really is <code>Rec Attr rs0</code> in order to use <code>rlens</code> (or probably <code>unAttr</code>), but it can't deduce that from the type family. (You know that there's only one type instance, but the compiler doesn't use that logic.)</p>

Internally the Mendix platform uses Ehcache to do that. </p>

<p>However it is not really possible to influence that cache as you would normally do in Java/Spring.This is due to all the functionality of the Mendix Platform, that already tries to cache all objects as efficiently as possible.<br>
Every object you create is always added to the cache. When working with that object it stays in cache until the Platform detects that the specific object can no longer be accessed either through the UI or a microflow.
There are also API calls available that instruct the platform to retain the object in cache regardless of it's usage. But that doesn't provide you with the flexibility as you asked for.
<br>
<br><br>
But specifically on your question, my initial response would be: Why would you want to cache a microflow output?<br>
Objects are already cached in memory, and the browser client only refreshes the cache when instructed. Any objects that you are using will be cached. 
Also when looking at most of the microflows that we use, I don't think it is likely that I would want to cache the output instead of re-running the microflows. Due to the design of the majority of the microflows I think it is likely that most microflows can return a slightly different output every time you execute it.</p>

<p>There are many listener classes you can subscribe to in the Mendix platform that allow you to trigger something in addition to the default action. But that would require some detailed knowledge of the current behavior.<br>
For example you can override the login action, but if you don't perform all the correct validations you could make the login process less secure. </p>

Fundamentally, every user is given control over his or her own profile, including picture, and there aren't field permissions for the user object. You can't modify other users, but you can modify your own. </p>

<p>I struggle to see why you would want to do this, as putting the burden of uploading a photo on the admin seems like busy work that would take away from them doing something more productive. But let's go with it. </p>

<p>Some backstory: The URL for the photo is contained in two <code>User</code> object fields: <code>FullPhotoURL</code> and <code>SmallPhotoURL</code>. </p>

<p>When a <code>User</code> record is first created, they are assigned the default blue smiley profile photo that looks like this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mXfE3.png"" alt=""Generic Salesforce Blue Smiley Profile Avatar""></p>

<p>The url for the default photos are always as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>FullPhotoURL</code>: <code>https://c.eu5.content.force.com/profilephoto/005/F</code></li>
<li><code>SmallPhotoURL</code>: <code>https://c.eu5.content.force.com/profilephoto/005/T</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If I update from the default to a new photo, the <code>FullPhotoURL</code> value would look like this: <code>https://c.eu5.content.force.com/profilephoto/72924000000CisD/F</code></p>

<p>And each time it is updated, the record id value above of <code>72924000000CisD</code> would be updated to a new one. </p>

<p>The normal fallback position in this case would be to have a trigger look for the modification to the field value and then stop the transaction, thus preventing the user from updating their photo. </p>

<p>However the profile photo upload process does not appear to cause a trigger to fire in my testing. </p>

<p>So the next option you have is to have a batch process that runs on a schedule. Unfortunately this leaves you with having to track the old values of every user's photo somewhere. So the high level steps for this workaround seem to be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Add a custom field to user to store the current profile photo url</li>
<li>Use a one-off batch Apex process, or some kind of data tool like data loader to populate this for existing users, create a workflow rule with a field update to populate it for new user records. </li>
<li>Periodically run a scheduled apex job to look for users with modified values in their profile photo fields</li>
<li>When you find those users, either flag it up, or revert to previous value. </li>
</ul>

<p>Not pretty, but it will put in place the control you want. </p>

<p>From there, you'll need to educate users that they need to expect this to happen. </p>

29910145,2,,29905159,2015-04-28T04:08:12.920,,12,,"<p>Let's begin by reviewing how <code>Dict</code> and <code>(:-)</code> are meant to be used.</p>

<pre><code>ordToEq :: Dict (Ord a) -&gt; Dict (Eq a)
ordToEq Dict = Dict
</code></pre>

<p>Pattern matching on a value <code>Dict</code> of type <code>Dict (Ord a)</code> brings the constraint <code>Ord a</code> into scope, from which <code>Eq a</code> can be deduced (because <code>Eq</code> is a superclass of <code>Ord</code>), so <code>Dict :: Dict (Eq a)</code> is well-typed.</p>

<pre><code>ordEntailsEq :: Ord a :- Eq a
ordEntailsEq = Sub Dict
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, <code>Sub</code> brings its input constraint into scope for the duration of its argument, allowing this <code>Dict :: Dict (Eq a)</code> to be well-typed as well.</p>

<p>However, whereas pattern-matching on <code>Dict</code> brings a constraint into scope, pattern-matching on <code>Sub Dict</code> does not bring into scope some new constraint conversion rule. In fact, unless the input constraint is already in scope, you can't pattern-match on <code>Sub Dict</code> at all.</p>

<pre><code>-- Could not deduce (Ord a) arising from a pattern
constZero :: Ord a :- Eq a -&gt; Int
constZero (Sub Dict) = 0

-- okay
constZero' :: Ord a =&gt; Ord a :- Eq a -&gt; Int
constZero' (Sub Dict) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>So that explains your first type error, <code>""Could not deduce (a c) arising from a pattern""</code>: you have tried to pattern-match on <code>Sub Dict</code>, but the input constraint <code>a c</code> was not already in scope.</p>

<p>The other type error, of course, is saying that the constraints you did manage to get into scope were not sufficient to satisfy the <code>RecAll f rs b</code> constraint. So, which pieces are needed, and which ones are missing? Let's look at the definition of <code>RecAll</code>.</p>

<pre><code>type family RecAll f rs c :: Constraint where
  RecAll f [] c = ()     
  RecAll f (r : rs) c = (c (f r), RecAll f rs c)
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! <code>RecAll</code> is a type family, so unevaluated as it is, with a completely abstract <code>rs</code>, the constraint <code>RecAll f rs c</code> is a black box which could not be satisfied from any set of smaller pieces. Once we specialize <code>rs</code> to <code>[]</code> or <code>(r : rs)</code>, it becomes clear which pieces we need:</p>

<pre><code>recAllNil :: Dict (RecAll f '[] c)
recAllNil = Dict

recAllCons :: p rs
           -&gt; Dict (c (f r))
           -&gt; Dict (RecAll f rs c)
           -&gt; Dict (RecAll f (r ': rs) c)
recAllCons _ Dict Dict = Dict
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using <code>p rs</code> instead of <code>Proxy rs</code> because it's more flexible: if I had a <code>Rec f rs</code>, for instance I could use that as my proxy with <code>p ~ Rec f</code>.</p>

<p>Next, let's implement a version of the above with <code>(:-)</code> instead of <code>Dict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>weakenNil :: RecAll f '[] c1 :- RecAll f '[] c2
weakenNil = Sub Dict

weakenCons :: p rs
           -&gt; c1 (f r) :- c2 (f r)
           -&gt; RecAll f rs c1 :- RecAll f rs c2
           -&gt; RecAll f (r ': rs) c1 :- RecAll f (r ': rs) c2
weakenCons _ entailsF entailsR = Sub $ case (entailsF, entailsR) of
    (Sub Dict, Sub Dict) -&gt; Dict
</code></pre>

<p><code>Sub</code> brings its input constraint <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c1</code> into scope for the duration of its argument, which we've arranged to include the rest of the function's body. The equation for the type family <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c1</code> expands to <code>(c1 (f r), RecAll f rs c1)</code>, which are thus both brought into scope as well. The fact that they are in scope allows us to pattern-match on the two <code>Sub Dict</code>, and those two <code>Dict</code> bring their respective constraints into scope: <code>c2 (f r)</code>, and <code>RecAll f rs c2</code>. Those two are precisely what the target constraint <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c2</code> expands to, so our <code>Dict</code> right-hand side is well-typed.</p>

<p>To complete our implementation of <code>weakenAllRec</code>, we will need to pattern-match on <code>rs</code> in order to determine whether to delegate the work to <code>weakenNil</code> or <code>weakenCons</code>. But since <code>rs</code> is at the type level, we cannot pattern-match on it directly. The <a href=""https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf"">Hasochism</a> paper explains how in order to pattern-match on a type-level <code>Nat</code>, we need to create a wrapper datatype <code>Natty</code>. The way in which <code>Natty</code> works is that each of its constructors is indexed by a corresponding <code>Nat</code> constructor, so when we pattern-match on a <code>Natty</code> constructor at the value level, the corresponding constructor is implied at the type level as well. We could define such a wrapper for type-level lists such as <code>rs</code>, but it just so happens that <code>Rec f rs</code> already has constructors corresponding to <code>[]</code> and <code>(:)</code>, and the callers of <code>weakenAllRec</code> are likely to have one lying around anyway.</p>

<pre><code>weakenRecAll :: Rec f rs
             -&gt; (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a)
             -&gt; RecAll f rs c1 :- RecAll f rs c2
weakenRecAll RNil       entails = weakenNil
weakenRecAll (fx :&amp; rs) entails = weakenCons rs entails
                                $ weakenRecAll rs entails
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the type of <code>entails</code> must be <code>forall a. c1 a :- c2 a</code>, not merely <code>c1 a :- c2 a</code>, because we don't want to claim that <code>weakenRecAll</code> will work for any <code>a</code> of the caller's choosing, but rather, we want to require the caller to prove that <code>c1 a</code> entails <code>c2 a</code> for every <code>a</code>.</p>

31481768,2,,31386733,2015-07-17T17:47:12.667,,1,,"<p>First, I'm assuming that you're using this PHP SDK by QuickbaseAdmirer <a href=""https://github.com/QuickbaseAdmirer/QuickBase-PHP-SDK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/QuickbaseAdmirer/QuickBase-PHP-SDK</a>.  There are a few potential problems with your code.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Double check that your constructor is correct.  Unless you've modified it, the Quickbase constructor in the SDK (again that I'm assuming you're using) takes user name, password, xml, database id, and then token in that order.  Whatever value is in <code>$config['debug']</code> may be taken as the token and the value of <code>$config['app_token']</code> may be taken as your realm.  Also, <code>$config['AA']</code> as used in the constructor should be a string of random seeming characters like ""bbqn1y5qv"".  Here's the constructor in the SDK for reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>public function __construct($un, $pw, $usexml = true, $db = '', $token
  = '', $realm = '', $hours = '')</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Your query <code>$xml = $qbc-&gt;do_query(""{'"" . $config['AA'] . ""'.EX.''}"", 0, 0, 'a', 0, '', '');</code> is not returning any records because <code>$config['AA']</code> is both being used as your DBID (in the constructor) and your field ID in the query.  The DBID must be a string and the field ID must be an integer that corresponds to the field you're making the query for.  For example, if you wanted to return records created today your query would be <code>'{1.IR.today}'</code> because 1 is always the field ID for date created.  It's also not returning any records because the SDK requires queries be passed as an array of arrays.  So, my records created today query needs to be rewritten as:</p>

<p><code>$query= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '1',
                        'ev' =&gt; 'IR'),
                        'cri' =&gt; 'today'),
                );</code></p>

<p>You'll also need to pass a string of period separated values to the clist parameter of the method or leave it blank for the table defaults. For example, if I wanted to get the date created and record ID for all records in this table sorted by date ascending, I would use this:</p>

<p><code>$query= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '3',
                        'ev' =&gt; 'GT'),
                        'cri' =&gt; '0'),
                );
$xml = $qbc-&gt;do_query($query, '', '', '1.3', '1', '', 'sortorder-A');</code></p>

<p>You can read up more on the Quickbase API, and do_query specifically, here <a href=""http://www.quickbase.com/api-guide/index.html#do_query.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quickbase.com/api-guide/index.html#do_query.html</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>The add record API call takes pairs of field IDs and values.  The SDK handles that by taking an array of arrays with 'fid' and 'value' pairs.  Assuming you want to put the value of <code>$record-&gt;record_id_</code> in field #37 and <code>$record-&gt;account_number</code> in field #30 your code should look like this:</p>

<p><code>foreach($xml-&gt;record as $record) {
   $records= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '37',  //Whatever field you want to store the value to
                        'value' =&gt; $record-&gt;record_id_),
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '30',
                        'value' =&gt; $record-&gt;account_number),
                  );
   $xml = $qbc-&gt;add_record($records);
}</code></p>

<p>Throw in a <code>print_r($xml);</code> at the end and you can see any response from Quickbase for debugging.  You should get something like this for a success:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>SimpleXMLElement Object ( [action] =&gt; API_AddRecord [errcode] =&gt; 0 [errtext] =&gt; No error [rid] =&gt; 81 [update_id] =&gt; 1436476140453 )</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The way your code is presented, you may not get the results you expect.  Your do query and add record method calls are performed on the same table and that isn't normally what someone would want.  Usually, the goal is to perform a do query on one table and then use that data to add records in a different table.  If that's the case, you'll need to change the database ID in your <code>$qbc</code> object before you preform the add record call.  This is easy enough to do with <code>$qbc-&gt;set_database_table('DBID');</code> where DBID is the target table ID (which should be a string of random seeming characters like ""bbqn1y5qv"").</p></li>

<pre><code>""javascript:alert(\""Hello World\"");void(0);""
</code></pre>

<p>You can also load a page that you've created using Dan Diebolt's image onload technique.  I can't find his original post, but you use the onload event of an image tag to load a .js file.  In this example it's a page in the same application named <code>module.js</code> that is being loaded using a Formula Text field with HTML enabled.</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;img qbu=\""module\"" src=\""/i/clear2x2.gif\"" onload=\""javascript:if(typeof QBU=='undefined'){QBU={};$.getScript('"" &amp; URLRoot() &amp; ""db/"" &amp; Dbid() &amp;  ?a=dbpage&amp;pagename=module.js&amp;rand='+Math.random())}\""&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>The corresponding <code>module.js</code> file might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
   alert(""Hello World"");
})(); 
</code></pre>

<p>You can take this as far as you'd like from writing functions in <code>module.js</code> that you call from Formula URL Fields to injecting your own HTML into the DOM (though Quickbase recommends you do not do that).  My favorite trick is to add <code>&lt;span id=""somethingUnique""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> either in the form builder or a text field with HTML enabled and use that to inject my custom buttons or data.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Looks like OutSystems Platform gives more priority to the Variable than the Special Variable.</p>

<p>So if the user selects a value that gets stored on the Variable, and then selects a value that gets stored on the Special Variable, you'll need to assign the Variable with NullIdentifier() for it to stop being displayed.</p>

<p>In this example I have a combo that displays users, and two other options.

<p>The problem is that if a user selects a value from the Source Entity, and later changes it to a value of the Special List (or the other way around), both variables will be set, and you'll need to decide which variable to unset.</p>

<p>You can use an auxiliary variable for this. On the OnChange event of the Combo box, set that variable to signal if the user chose something from the Source Entity, or the Special List.</p>

<li><p>The root container is an array not an object so needs to be deserialized into a collection, say <code>List&lt;Folder&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The array contains two entries: a JSON object and nested JSON array.  The <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/docs/zoho-docs-api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> is vague, but it looks like these folders are recursive, and an array of folders will contain pairs of folder/child folder array containers.  Since Json.NET decides whether to serialize a POCO based on whether or not it implements <code>IEnumerable</code>, there is no single class that can be deserialized from both a JSON array and a JSON object.  Thus it will be necessary to create a custom JSON converter for a <code>List&lt;Folder&gt;</code> to skip through the array and match up the folders with their arrays of children.</p></li>

            {
                case JTokenType.Object:

<ol>
<li>Trigger a logic when the input box changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The input box has a property called ""Destination"" inside the ""On Change"" section. In that property, you can assign an action (imagine an action as a Java or .NET method). As you can figure out, that will be the action that will run when you change the input box text;</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Update the search result.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the action assigned to the ""Destination"" property, you should rerun the search using the ""Refresh Data"" widget and selecting the query. Then you must need to refresh the element in the screen. To do that, you can use the ""Ajax Refresh"" widget, and select the widget that is displaying the results.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let's imagine that you have a data entity called ""City"" that represents.. a city. In the screen, you have an input box and below a ""Table Records"" with the list of cities. As you type in the input box, the ""Table Records"" is filtered using the value of the variable assigned to the input box.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you assign an action to the ""Destination"" property of the input box (let's call the action ""OnChange""). In the ""OnChange"" action, you rerun the aggregate being used to display the cities names (and that has a condition <em>City.Name like InputBox_Var + ""%""</em>) using the ""Refresh Data"".</p>

<p>After that, you put the ""Ajax Refresh"" widget next to the ""Refresh Data"", and select the aggregate (ensure that the aggregate has a name, otherwise you can't select it).</p>

<p>It should work!</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your host is not open relay: i.e. anonymous can't conntect to its 25 port and send anything to anyone (there are open relay check engines over the Internet, use them)</li>
<li>Have some meaningful reverse DNS record. Your IP should resolve to something like <code>mx.&lt;YOUR_EMAIL_DOMAIN&gt;</code>, not <code>44.33.22.191.clients-dsl.my.local.isp.net</code></li>

32575808,2,,32571070,2015-09-15T00:23:06.647,,1,,"<p>I think you may be missing something in your query.  If you're trying to get a  list of records where the field 12 is 1157 and field 8 is equal to <code>$Child_ID</code> you'll need to add <code>AND</code> into your query.  When using the API in a URL the query would be <code>&amp;query={12.EX.1175}AND{8.EX.77}</code> if, for example, the child ID were 77.  To do that in the PHP SDK for Quickbase you add <code>'ao' =&gt; 'AND'</code> to all arrays following the first query array.  Try updating your $queries array to this:</p>

<pre><code>$queries = array( //this is the where clause now for the delete query
                array(
                    'fid'  =&gt; '12',
                    'ev'   =&gt; 'EX',
                    'cri'  =&gt; '1175'
                ),
                array(
                    'ao'   =&gt; 'AND',  // Saying that 12.EX.1175 AND 8.EX.$Child_ID
                    'fid'  =&gt; '8',
                    'ev'   =&gt; 'EX',
                    'cri'  =&gt; $Child_ID
                )
);
</code></pre>

<p>My PHP skills aren't particularly good, but you'll need to do a bit more to get the record ID#.  In the original code, I think that <code>$record-&gt;f[3]</code> will just return to SimpleXMLObject for the third field in the array.  That won't necessarily be field ID 3 (the record ID).  You can either choose to not use the structured format (and change all of your code to match) or add a loop that goes through all the fields and deletes when it reaches the field with id 3:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($results-&gt;table-&gt;records-&gt;record as $record){ //getting results of delete query
    //Loop through all fields to find id 3
    foreach($record-&gt;f as $field){
        if($field['id'] == ""3""){
            $Deletevar = $field['id'];
            $deleted = $qb-&gt;delete_record($Deletevar); //deleting result
            print_r($deleted);
            break;  //Stops this loop since FID 3 was found
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some performance notes:  If you aren't using any other fields,  you can set your query to only return record IDs by passing a clist that is just '3'.  Also, each <code>delete_record()</code> is a separate API call.  There is another method <code>purge_records</code> that allows you pass a query and Quickbase deletes all of the records that match your query.  You may want to look into using <code>purge_records()</code> because you can you use it in place of your <code>do_query()</code> and avoid all the loops.  It uses fewer of your resources and Quickbase's to process as well.</p>

In that case you'll have a lot of freedom to manipulate the text as you wish and you can convert it to binary format and write it to the file when you're done.</p>

<p>The main idea is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a variable... let's call it <code>fileContent</code> and set its type to <code>Text</code></li>
<li>In the <code>ForEach</code> loop, instead of <code>ListAppend</code> use an <code>Assign</code> node</li>
<li>In the assign node, set <code>fileContent</code> as the variable</li>
<li>For the value, use something like <code>fileContent + StructureFNMA2RecordList.Current.Name + [...rest of your fields...] + NewLine()</code> &rArr; you're essentially appending content to the fileContent variable</li>
<li>Outside the loop, use your Download node just with <code>TextToBinaryData(fileContent)</code> because by now the variable contains everything you'll want to write in the file</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you a file with the fields in each line. You'll probably want to put something between the fields because concatenating <code>Name</code> and <code>Phonenumber</code> will give you <code>Bankat12345</code> but if you put a space <code>"" ""</code> or something else in between you'll have a more readable <code>Bankat 12345</code>.</p>

<p>Once you fetched the data you need to iterate over the returned list of elements and append the information you want to a string using the StringBuilder actions you'll find in Text extension. Finally the export this as a binary file use the TextToBinaryData action from the BinaryData extension and use this output in a Download tool.

For the purpose of this answer, lets say I have create one plugin named <code>LogoutPlugin</code> and that the available method is <code>logout</code>.</p>

<p>As for the communication between the webapp and OutSystems Now application, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install OutSystems Now from forge - needed to connect you OutSystems Now mobile app to your environment.</li>
<li>Install Now Plugin common from forge - needed to load the cordova javascript file from the OutSystems Now application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>On Service Studio, and in your application, add reference to ""Now Plugin common</li>
<li>Add reference to HTTPRequestHandler/RunJavaScript</li>
<li>Create a webblock and drag, into it, the NativePluginLoader from Now Plugin commons and a button. 

<ul>
<li>Change the button method to ajax submit and create a new Screen Action, I called mine ""Logout""</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Open the ""Logout"" screen action and drag RunJavaScript action into it. This will be where we'll call the cordova plugin that we want! Since, in the beginning of this answer, I said I created LogoutPlugin, we would call it like so:</p>

<p><code>cordova.exec(function(){console.log(""success"");}, function(e){console.log(""fail"" + e);}, ""LogoutPlugin"", ""logOut"", []);</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the native side, for example for Android, the plugin class would look something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class LogoutPlugin extends CordovaPlugin {

    @Override
    public boolean execute(String action, JSONArray args, CallbackContext callbackContext) {

        if (action.equals(""logout""))
            logout();
        return true;
    }

    private void logout() {
        cordova.getActivity().finish();
    }

First of all, you need to create the basic Thunderbird extension layout including a chrome.manifest, install.rdf, etc. This is the same layout as in traditional Firefox add-ons, sometimes called ""Legacy Extensions"" there.

In Chrome it's possible to hide this automatic header/footer using:</p>

<p>Since the contents will extend to page's limits, the page printing header/footer will be absent. You should, of course, in this case, set some margins/paddings in your body element so that the content won't extend all the way to the page's edge. Since common printers just can't get no-margins printing and it's probably not what you want, you should use something like this:</p>

  @page { margin: 0; }

<p>The EnabledDays from the Silk UI Calendar does not allow you to select the year, so when you add the year to the JSON, the calendar does not know what to do with it, and returns an exception to the browser's console.</p>

<p>However, there are 2 options to solve this issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can use another element (in the image bellow I used a buttongroup) to filter the year outside the calendar. Then, by doing an Ajax Refresh, get the data for that year and refresh the calendar.</li>
</ol>

<li>You can copy the calendar pattern to your own application and change the EnableDays code to also work with the year.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you may have noticed on this last image, <strong>this calendar pattern is deprecated</strong> (since Version 1.1.0, released on 16 July 2015), and the new version of the calendar, does the exact opposite, which is select the disabled dates.</p>

<p>Although this second option is a bit harder to implement, and having in consideration that at a certain point the deprecated patterns may be deleted, it will allow you to keep upgrading Silk UI without loosing any functionality to your application.</p>

As a good reviewer, I will start with positives</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ol>
<li>The platform is awesome for CRUD apps. If you just want to create tables, enter data and save. This is really easy with OutSystems and you can do it quickly.</li>
<li>Excellent REST integration. You can integrate with REST easily.</li>
<li>Centralize user/session management.</li>
<li>Free error and performance moniotoring</li>
<li>Excellent Product support. I have not seen such a support in a while.</li>
<li>Supports extension in .net, using Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Excellent Bootstrap based layout for easy layout creation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Support for javascript and DOM manipulation sucks.Basically you have to write string blobs. </li>
<li>The Ajax is not really a Ajax. Possibly, it's worst than full page reload. It reloads complete DOM. It's a shame they are using 2006 technology in 2016.</li>
<li>No knowledge base. Just google and you won't find answer to any OutSystems questions. It's big drawback. They have forum but it really is not stackoverflow :-)</li>
<li>Java version is lame. So practically only supports .net.</li>
<li>Every single change need to be uploaded to server before you see.</li>
<li>No string merge support. This is the worst source control in the world. I mean, we are living in the time of GIT.</li>
<li>No proper user groups out of the box.</li>
<li>Only admins can create connection strings, so admin is stuck with that job.</li>
<li>Deployment get stuck if are deploying lots of app. </li>
<li>Only strong references so you will have tons of dependencies. That creates deployment nightmare.</li>
<li>Does not play with angular due to fake ajax.</li>

To avoid this error, you need to reduce the number of records being returned by the query.  If you aren't actually using all of the returned records in your program, you should structure your query so that you exclude records that you aren't using.  If you do, in fact, need all of the records in that table you'll need to download them in batches and then merge the datasets.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I've never programmed C# so I can't help you with the syntax, but to download records in batches you can use <code>API_GetSchema</code> on your table DBID to get the next record id (table.original.next_record_id).  This number is what the record ID will be for the next record to be created.  So, you know that all of your record IDs are less than that number.  Using a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 20,000 you can query for records where the record id is greater than the lower bound and less than the upperbound.  Merge the results with an existing dataset, increase both bounds by 20,000 and repeat until the lower bound exceeds the next record id number.  At the end you should have a single dataset and code that should scale with your Quickbase table.</p>

<p>Also, for development/troubleshooting purposes I highly recommend using Fiddler to see exactly the REST call that PowerApps is doing and making sure the URL and parameters are correct.

Each record in the report has a <code>DIV</code> with <code>id='mydivTable'</code>.  The id values aren't meant to be repeated in a document and doing so can result in unexpected behavior.  In this instance, your <code>$('#mydivTable')</code> call in your script is returning only the first element.  Fortunately, it appears to be a relatively easy fix.</p>

<p>First, change the first line in the formula of your <code>forcedgraph</code> field so that you give the <code>DIV</code> a class name of ""mydivTable"" instead of an id:</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;div class='div-table mydivTable' style='width: 355px;' data='""
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can query for all elements that have 'mydivTable' as a class.  Change your script file so that you're looking for classes instead of ids:</p>

<pre><code>  $("".mydivTable"").each(function() {
      var Rec = $(this).attr('data');
</code></pre>

<p>Changing <code>""#mydivTable""</code> to <code>this</code> ensures that you are assigning the value of the 'data' attribute for the specific element that <code>.each()</code> is iterating through to <code>Rec</code>.  Using <code>""#mydivtable""</code> will return nothing now that we've changed your field and using <code>"".mydivTable""</code> will return a collection of elements instead of just one.  </p>

<p>It should start working after those changes.  At least it did for me in my own mock up.</p>

<ol>
<li>Loads the original record from the database or initializes the record for an upsert statement.</li>
<li>Loads the new record field values from the request and overwrites the old values. If the request came from a standard UI edit page, Salesforce runs system validation to check the record for:

<li>Compliance with layout-specific rules</li>
<li>Required values at the layout level and field-definition level</li>
<li>Valid field formats</li>
<li>Maximum field length</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>When the request comes from other sources, such as an Apex application or a SOAP API call, Salesforce validates only the foreign keys. Prior to executing a trigger, Salesforce verifies that any custom foreign keys do not refer to the object itself.</p>

<p>Salesforce runs user-defined validation rules if multiline items were created, such as quote line items and opportunity line items.</p>

<ol start=""3"">

<li>Runs most system validation steps again, such as verifying that all required fields have a non-null value, and runs any user-defined validation rules. The only system validation that Salesforce doesn't run a second time (when the request comes from a standard UI edit page) is the enforcement of layout-specific rules.</li>
<li>Executes duplicate rules. If the duplicate rule identifies the record as a duplicate and uses the block action, the record is not saved and no further steps, such as after triggers and workflow rules, are taken.</li>
<li>Saves the record to the database, but doesn't commit yet.</li>
<li>Executes all after triggers.</li>
<li>Executes assignment rules.</li>
<li>Executes auto-response rules.</li>
<li>Executes workflow rules.</li>
<li>If there are workflow field updates, updates the record again.</li>
<li>If the record was updated with workflow field updates, fires before update triggers and after update triggers one more time (and only one more time), in addition to standard validations. Custom validation rules, duplicate rules, and escalation rules are not run again.</li>

38380487,2,,38376454,2016-07-14T17:23:27.547,,0,,"<p>It looks like there are a couple issues causing your code to not work.  First, let me make a distinction between ""Calculated Fields"" and ""Formula Fields"" in Quickbase.  Calculated fields are defined in the report view (meaning they are viewable only in that report and no other) and do not allow HTML.  Formula fields, on the other hand, are created like traditional fields and allow you to select a checkbox allowing some HTML.  You'll need to use a formula field to get code to run in a form or report.  You'll also need to make sure you make the field visible in your report otherwise the code won't be executed.</p>

<p>Once that is resolved, your script probably won't run because Quickbase limits the HTML tags allowed.  Instead of changing the images, you'll just see the text of your script displayed in the field.  You can get around this by putting your script in the <code>onload</code> tag of an <code>IMG</code> element.  This will have the added effect of no longer requiring <code>document.ready(function(){});</code> to properly execute.</p>

<p>Finally, the last problem is the selector.  Even though you are using a formula field attached to a specific record, the script itself executes for the entire page.  In order to select only the <code>img</code> elements for the records where Task Name is ""Vacation"", you'll need a way to distinguish between rows.  Fortunately, the timeline report wraps each row in a <code>div</code> giving it an ID of ""rid"" + the record id.</p>

<p>So, if you put that all together you should end up with a formula text field with ""Allow some HTML tags to be inserted in the field"" checked and this as the formula: </p>

<pre><code>If([Task Name]=""Vacation"", ""&lt;img qbu=\""module\"" src=\""/i/clear2x2.gif\"" onload=\""javascript:$('#rid"" &amp; [Record ID#] &amp; "" &gt; td:has(div.timeline) &gt; div.timeline &gt; img').attr('src',('https://images.quickbase.com/si/16/821-check_purple.png'));\""&gt;"", """")
</code></pre>

<p>I tested the above formula in my own timeline report and it worked as expected.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To exclude the clear2x2.gif image that Quickbase places for spacing automatically when editing the source:</p>

<pre><code>If([Task Name]=""Vacation"", ""&lt;img qbu=\""module\"" src=\""/i/clear2x2.gif\"" onload=\""javascript:$('#rid"" &amp; [Record ID#] &amp; "" &gt; td:has(div.timeline) &gt; div.timeline &gt; img:not([src^=&amp;quot;/i/clear2x2.gif&amp;quot;])').attr('src',('https://images.quickbase.com/si/16/821-check_purple.png'));\""&gt;"", """")

Single mail server MX can be set as default. You can set two different MX record but that would work as fail-over, it can't split your delivery.</p>

<p>Yes it is possible, the technology called Dual Delivery OR Split Delivery.  When emails are addressed to email addresses that are not found in one mail server it will send its delivery to another mail server and even can split them.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong><br>
domain.com has default mx record set to Zoho. User abc@domain.com is set under google apps &amp; user xyz@domain.com under Zoho. Now if someone send mail to abc@domain.com which is configured under google apps, so the first request transferred to Zoho but zoho cannot found that email within organization so it will push the request to Google apps and will deliver the mail in its inbox.</p>

<p>Google Apps also offer dual delivery but unfortunately its available for Google Apps for Work account only. Zoho is offering it for all type of accounts so you still have chance to get it done via zoho.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li>Set up your domain MX record to Zoho</li>
<li>Configure delivery as per guideline mentioned here</li>
</ol>

38755566,2,,38688679,2016-08-04T00:09:59.607,,0,,"<p>It looks like there are several steps to setting up your account to access S3 through JavaScript.  After your bucket is created, you need to setup CORS by accessing the properties of the bucket and choosing to edit the CORS configuration.  You mentioned giving read/write access to your company's domain so you have probably already done this.  I used this one from Amazon to test:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;CORSConfiguration xmlns=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/""&gt;
&lt;CORSRule&gt;
    &lt;AllowedOrigin&gt;https://mycompany.quickbase.com&lt;/AllowedOrigin&gt;
    &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;PUT&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;
    &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;POST&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;
    &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;DELETE&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt;
    &lt;AllowedHeader&gt;*&lt;/AllowedHeader&gt;
&lt;/CORSRule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The second part is to create an IAM user in the <a href=""https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/"" rel=""nofollow"">Identity and Access Management Console</a>.  In the process of creating the user, Amazon will generate an access key ID and secret access key pair automatically.  You'll need these for the API call later.  You also need to attach a policy that establishes permissions for the user.  I used the AmazonS3FullAccess policy for my test.  All of this is done through that console.</p>

<p>Once your IAM user is setup you can pass the access key id and secret access key to the AWS configurator before instantiating the S3 object using the JavaScript SDK from Amazon.  </p>

<pre><code>AWS.config.update({accessKeyId: 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP', secretAccessKey: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7i8j9k0+0012ab'});
var bucket = new AWS.S3({params: {Bucket: 'myBucketName'}});
</code></pre>

<p>From there you can use the <code>bucket</code> object to call any of the S3 methods in the SDK including uploading your file.</p>

First, I am using <a href=""https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/3756"" rel=""nofollow"">HttpAgent</a> to Post the URL. Next, in the HttpAgent.post(), I have the following layout for my URL:</p>

<p>The data variable is a series of StringBuffers with the following layout:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuffer variablename1 = new StringBuffer();
                        if(Checkboxname1.isChecked()){
                            variablename.append(""&lt;FL%20val=\""CRM Field Name\""&gt;CRM Field Value&lt;/FL&gt;"");
                        }
</code></pre>

<p>I need the if statement to check to see if a certain checkbox is checked and if it is, to update the CRM field the checkbox is associated with in my case, others may not need it. I then append them together with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuffer data = new StringBuffer();

data.append(variablename1.toString() + variablename2.toString()...);
</code></pre>

39150859,2,,39149917,2016-08-25T16:56:27.890,,4,,"<p>This is a matter of which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> you look at on Github and which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> your local <code>gulp</code> installation is using.</p>

<p>You probably installed gulp from <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>npmjs.com</code></a> by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install --save-dev gulp
</code></pre>

<p>This currently installs version <code>3.9.1</code> of gulp. You can see which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> the <code>3.9.1</code> version of gulp depends on by using <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>npm ls</code></a>. Here's the (abbreviated) output from that command:</p>

<pre><code>‚îî‚îÄ‚î¨ gulp@3.9.1
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚î¨ vinyl-fs@0.3.14
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚î¨ vinyl@0.4.6
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>gulp@3.9.1</code> depends on <code>vinyl-fs@0.3.14</code> and <code>vinyl-fs@0.3.14</code> depends on <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code>.</p>

<p>Here are links to those version on GitHub:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs/tree/v0.3.14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs/tree/v0.3.14</a> <br>
<a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/tree/v0.4.6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/tree/v0.4.6</a></p>

<p>As you can see on GitHub <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code> does <strong>not</strong> have a <code>._isVinyl</code> property. Only newer versions like <code>vinyl@1.2.0</code> <a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/blob/v1.2.0/index.js#L36"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have this property</a>.</p>

<p>Since <code>gulp@3.9.1</code> emits vinyl files using <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code> the vinyl files emitted by your gulp installation don't have the <code>._isVinyl</code> property. And that's why the <code>vinyl.isVinyl()</code> function returns <code>false</code> in your example.</p>

<p>The current <a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">development version for the upcoming gulp 4.0</a> uses <code>vinyl@1.2.0</code> . If you were to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34267286/5892036"">install that version of gulp</a> the <code>vinyl.isVinyl()</code> call in your example would return <code>true</code>.</p>

The rule can parse the location with regex, and allow you to change the port. I'm not sure if this accomplishes everything you are setting out to do (if port must be dynamic) but it should at least get you most the way there.</p>

<p>The pattern <code>(https?://[^:/]+):?([0-9]+)?(.*)</code> will parse the location as follows:</p>

<pre><code>https://sub.host.com:1337/foo/bar?query=true

{R:1} =&gt; https://sub.host.com
{R:2} =&gt; 1337
{R:3} =&gt; /foo/bar?query=true

<p><sup>Note: If the port is not in the URL, <code>{R:2}</code> will be empty.</sup></p>

<p>Here is the <a href=""http://resources.docs.salesforce.com/202/9/en-us/sfdc/pdf/salesforce_packaging_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">complete document link</a> for the app creation and publishing on app Exchange, you can go thought it and find all the answers step by step.</p>

<p>So below are the very short answers of the question I asked.</p>

<ul>
<li>Where to start for creating an slesforce app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1: Sign Up for the Partner Program</p>

<p>Step 2: Create a Development and Test Environment</p>

<p>Step 3: Get a Business Org</p>

<p>After doing the above 3 steps you can get a environment hub into Business Org, By which we can create different organization to create the app in one org (that is dev org) and install and test into the other org( that is test org).</p>

<ul>
<li>The app we create from the Salesform CRM account and app listing on AppExchange is different?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, From Your CRM account you can create the app, package the app in beta version. Once you done the testing with beta app by installing it into your Test Org you can deploy it for app exchange, After security review you app will be available into app exchange publicly. You can do it from your salesforce CRM account itself (See the above doc for more details) </p>

<ul>
<li>Is this apps are hosted on salesforce itself or hosted in our own server?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of app: </p>

<p>1.VisualForce Pages app: This app is besically a collection of VisualForce Pages and reside or hosted into the saleforce itself.</p>

<p>2.Connected App: Connected app also includes the VisualForce pages as need but it also provide the client id and client secret key by which we can authenticate the user and call the Salesforce REST API from the outside of the CRM. So we can say this is something we can host the API access code into our own server.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which scripting language is required to code the Salesforce app?</li>
</ul>

<p>For Coding into the VisualForce pages we required Salesforce Apex Scripting and HTML.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we call the external API's inside the Salesforce app?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, Using the Apex HTTP class we can call the external API's into the salesForce.</p>

<p>Hope this will help someone.</p>

There are multiple ways you could work around this, my approach was to switch to EmailMessage which has a richer interface and allows you to pass the Content-type in a header.</p>

<p>Switching from this:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core import mail
mail.send_mail(subject='Hello',
               message='Body goes here',
               from_email='user@example.com',
               recipient_list=['user@example.com'])
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core.mail import EmailMessage
email = EmailMessage(
    subject='Hello',
    body='Body goes here',
    from_email='user@example.com',
    to=['user@example.com'],
    reply_to=['user@example.com'],
    headers={'Content-Type': 'text/plain'},
)
email.send()
</code></pre>

<p>Other Zoho mail settings:</p>

<pre><code>EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.zoho.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'user@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_USE_SSL = False
</code></pre>

<p>This solved my issues with Zoho mail sending and is compatible with other queuing plugins like django-yubin.</p>

  <p>When you import an XML schema (.xsd file) or web service definition
  (.wsdl file) using the Mendix Business Modeler, you might get a dialog
  that contains warning messages about unsupported constructs. This is
  because currently Mendix does not support the entire XSD standard. The
  mapping in Mendix is based on entities and attributes, and some XSD
  constructs do not lend themselves easily for this format. The
  following table shows which XSD constructs are supported in Mendix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>The table goes on to say that <code>xsd:any</code> is not supported.</em></strong></p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to use their tool, you cannot use <code>xsd:any</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is how do I find out what type of responses are valid for
  the any parameter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By definition, any XML can go there; that's the point of <code>xsd:any</code>.  (See details about <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27420156/processcontents-strict-vs-lax-vs-skip-for-xsdany"">how to use <code>xsd:any/@processContents</code></a>)  In order to limit the XML that can go there and be able to use the Mendix Business Modeler, you'll have to define the XML in terms of the <a href=""https://docs.mendix.com/refguide6/XML+Schema+Support"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">limited set of XSD features that Mendix supports</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not control <code>DOCUMENT</code> contents, then you'll have to consult with the authority that does.  <strong>Hint</strong>: I've seen <code>CREDIT_RESPONSE_v2_3_1</code> used in <a href=""http://www.mismo.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>MISMO (Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization)</strong></a> XML.</p>

<p>In several cases this will be enough, however there are a little tricks for saving API calls like using the API V4 in which you can insert/update multiples records (100 per request).</p>

<p>Also, you can use the custom function (zoho deluge) in the CRM and set yours workflow rules like: </p>

<p>Each time a new lead is created with the status ""Not contacted"" then:  </p>

<li>Send a welcome email</li>
<li>Create a case (zoho deluge) </li>
<li>Create a taks (zoho deluge)  </li>

<p>The rate limit for zoho custom functions is not the same as zoho api calls. (Integration Tasks - 25000 Zoho API calls/day using deluge.) So you can use both of them. </p>

<p>First is versioning.<br />
<code>@RestResource(urlMapping = '/DemoEndpoint/v1/*')</code></p>

<p>By adding the v1 your end users can use the different versions and upgrade to newer versions when ready. The next version may be<br />
<code>@RestResource(urlMapping = '/DemoEndpoint/v2/*')</code></p>

<p>Versioning is recommended for API endpoints.
You will need to create separate classes for each version.</p>

<p>The second method is to change how you accept the input parameters.
In this scenario remove the input parameters in the method definition, and use Request.requestbody.</p>

<p>This is the original code (assuming you followed the developer guide example)<br />
<code>@HttpPost
global static void myPostMethod(string Element1, string Element2, string Element3, string Element4)</code></p>

<p>New code accepting 3 or 4 parameters (or 0 parameters, see note below).</p>

<pre><code>@HttpPost
global static string myPostMethod() {
    RestRequest request = RestContext.request;
    String body = request.requestBody.toString();
    List&lt;Wrapper&gt; obj = (List&lt;Wrapper&gt;) JSON.deserialize(body, List&lt;Wrapper&gt;.Class);
</code></pre>

<p>The wrapper class would be</p>

<pre><code>public class Wrapper{
    string Element1;
    string Element2;
    string Element3;
    string Element4;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If Element4 is empty it was not passed in. Using this method you will need to do input validation. For example, this will accept zero parameters and all elements will be empty.</p>

<p>You can set up a custom property of type ""Dynamic"" and call it anything, take ""onConfirmCallback"", for example. Then you can set the function on that custom property:</p>

<p>Code to invoke dialog:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback = function(param) {
  alert(param); 
};
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the onClick for the close button:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback(""hi"");
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that there are slightly better ways to set up labels than in your example, also using custom properties.</p>

<p>Create custom properties for any widget properties you want to customize, and then bind those custom properties (@properties.propertyName) to the widget property. For example you might have a confirmText property, with the confirm buttons text property boudn to @properties.confirmText.</p>

<p>Then when you invoke your dialog, you can just set those custom properties. Quick modification of your example code using properties for everything:</p>

<pre><code>function confirmationDialog(msg, confirmFunction)
{
  var properties = app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties;
  properties.text = msg;
  properties.confirmCallback = confirmFunction;

  app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);
}

  var allEmails = [];

  return allEmails.join();      

}

<p>Then add a script to the button widget ""onclick"" event that will run the server script and manipulate the returned data. Something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>function poulateToField(response){

  &lt;widget path&gt;.text/value = response;

}

google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(poulateToField).getEmails();

<blockquote>
  <p>Projections let you access properties from records in a datasource's
  items list. Access projections with the ..projections.. option in the
  advanced binding wizard, or use the projection operator .. in a
  binding path. For example, for an Employees datasource with a name
  property, @datasources.Employee.items..name returns a list of all
  employees' names.</p>

<p>You can check the ""Call Scripts"" guide which shows you how to send emails using App Maker which is available here <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/tutorials/call-scripts/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/tutorials/call-scripts/</a></p>

<p>To use projections and following the above guide, in <strong>Step #2</strong> under ""Create the UI"": Add a text box for the recipient:</p>

<p>c. In the Property Editor, instead of entering the ""To"" value to the Textbox widget, you can select Binding and bind the widget to the Datasource projections following this path: <strong>datasource > items > ..projections.. > Email</strong> (name of the datasource field where the emails are located)</p>

<p>For example a projection will look like this: <strong>@datasource.items..email</strong></p>

<p>This will automatically bind all emails that are available in your datasource to the text box widget. Then you can complete the guide and emails will be sent to all the email addresses in your datasource. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Is your OutSystems environment on-premises or in the cloud? Either way, you need to make sure that this server is able to reach - it as connectivity - to your MySQL database server. Using localhost or 127.0.0.1 is pretty much the same thing as this is an address for the machine where the request is running, which is, in this case, the OutSystems server. Do you have the MySQL database on your local machine? This is not a good approach as you will need to have an address that won't change otherwise the connection won't be stable and you'd have to reconfigure it all the time.</p>

<p>(Alternatively, you could just remove the field altogether if it's not important to show the relation.)</p>

<p>I think this only answers the ""not editable"" part of your question, if you want it to be pre-filled you either need to do some scripting, or use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#relation_datasources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relation data sources</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest using relation data sources, so right now you probably have something like:</p>

<p><code>app.datasources.Emp.create()</code>, which creates a new employee.</p>

<p>Instead, you can use <code>widget.datasource.relations.Emp.create()</code>, which will create a new employee which has a relation to the current item in widget.datasource. If this button is placed in your department form widget, then that means it will create an employee related to whatever department is shown in the form.</p>

<p>Note that none of this stops users from changing the department of an employee, it just changes the UI. In lots of cases that is enough, but you may also want to add some server-side security controls if it's important to limit which users can create employees, change departments, etc: See <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/security/secure-app-data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/security/secure-app-data</a></p>

<p>""
So, here is what I did:</p>

<p>Went into my Model, went under Datasources and added a new Datasource.</p>

<p>Ex name: Room201</p>

<p>Then in the Query builder I put in the Field I was trying to narrow by.</p>

<p>ex: Room = :Query</p>

<p>(Room = my field, and I believe the "":Query"" is the just name of the query, someone can correct me if I'm wrong)</p>

<p>Then you'll see a box below that window where you can add a binding. So THAT is where I put in my query.</p>

<p>ex: @datasources.Facilities.query.filters.Room._equals = 201</p>

<p>(Note: I had to create a separate Datasource for each room)</p>

<p>Then I went to my widget and chose the queried datasource (Room201) for the datasource.</p>

<p>So Widget 1 = the datasource Room201, Widget 2 = the datasource Room202, etc.</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps someone!

After you added Directory model you have multiple ways to serve user's Full Name:</p>

<p>1 Save it to your database when record is created</p>

<pre><code>// onCreate
var email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();

var directoryQuery = app.models.Directory.newQuery();
directoryQuery.filters.PrimaryEmail._equals = email;
var reporter = directoryQuery.run()[0];

record.reported_by = email;
record.reported_full_name = reporter.FullName;
record.Date = new Date();
</code></pre>

<p>and then use this 'reported_full_name' in binding instead of 'reported_by'.</p>

<ul>
<li>pros - better performance when you render multiple records on UI </li>
<li>cons values in your DB can eventually become obsolete</li>
</ul>

<p>2 Use calculated model and make dynamic 'virtual relation' between your local model and Directory</p>

<ul>
<li>pros - you will always have actual data</li>
<li>cons - it will work slower, it will be harder to maintain and implement</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Query server for Full Name after datasource is loaded on UI</p>

<pre><code>// widget binding
setFullName(widget, @datasource.item.reported_by)

// client script
setFullName(widget, email) {
  google.script.run

  var directoryQuery = app.models.Directory.newQuery();
  directoryQuery.filters.PrimaryEmail._equals = email;
  var person = directoryQuery.run()[0];

41948395,2,,41944876,2017-01-31T01:36:06.583,,4,,"<p>To get exactly what you'd want you'd have to do a lot of work.</p>

<p>Here is my suggested, simpler answer:</p>

<p>Don't open up a new tab. If you use showPage like you mention, and provide a ""back"" button on the page to go back to where you were, you'll get pretty much everything you need. If you don't want the back to show up when you print, then you can setVisibility(false) on the button before you print, then print, then setVisibility(true).</p>

<hr>

<p>I'll give a quick summary of how you could do this with a new tab, but it's pretty involved so I can't go into details without trying it myself. The basic idea, is you want to open the page with a full URL, just like a user was navigating to it. </p>

<p>You can use #TestPrint to indicate which page you want to load. You also need the URL of your application, which as far as I can remember is only available in a server-side script using the Apps Script method: ScriptApp.getService().getUrl(). On top of this, you'll probably need to pass in the key so that your page knows what data to load.</p>

<p>So given this, you need to assemble a url by calling a server script, then appending the key property to it. In the end you want a url something like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.script.google.com/yourappaddress#TestPage?key=keyOfYourModel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.script.google.com/yourappaddress#TestPage?key=keyOfYourModel</a>.</p>

<p>Then on TestPage you need to read the key, and load data for that key. (You can read the key using <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/reference/url"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google.script.url</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, I think there are some tricks you can play by opening a blank window and then writing directly to its DOM, but I've never tried that, and since Apps Script runs inside an iframe I'm not sure if it's possible. If I get a chance I'll play with it and update this answer, but for your own reference you could look here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27248259/create-html-page-and-print-to-new-tab-in-javascript"">create html page and print to new tab in javascript</a></p>

<p>I'm imagining something like that, except that your page an write it's html content. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>var winPrint = window.open('', '_blank', 'left=0,top=0,width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,status=0');
winPrint.document.write(app.pages.TestPage.getElement().innerHTML);
winPrint.document.close();
winPrint.focus();
winPrint.print();
winPrint.close();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Hope one of those three options helps :)</p>

<p>I added a Print Button to a Page Fragment that pops up when a user edits a database entry.</p>

<p>Database Edit Button code:</p>

<pre><code>app.datasources.ModelName.selectKey(widget.datasource.item._key);
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.FragmentName);
</code></pre>

<p>That Print Button goes to a different (full) Page and closes the Fragment. </p>

<p>Print Button Code:</p>

<pre><code>app.datasources.ModelName.selectKey(widget.datasource.item._key);
app.showPage(app.pages.ModelName_Print);
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>I made sure to make the new Print Page was small enough so that Chrome fits it properly into a 8.5 x 11"" page (728x975). </p>

<p>I then created a Panel that fills the page and populated the page with Labels</p>

<pre><code>@datasource.item.FieldName
</code></pre>

<p>I then put the following into the onDataLoad for the Panel</p>

<pre><code>window.print();
</code></pre>

<p>So now when the user presses the Print Button in the Fragment they are taken to this new page and after the data loads they automatically get a print dialog. </p>

<p>The only downside is that after printing the user has to use a back button I added to return to the database page. </p>

41954168,2,,41944876,2017-01-31T09:42:59.457,,0,,"<p><strong>1.</strong> Here is how it is done, in a pop up window, without messing up the current page (client script):</p>

<pre><code>function print(widget, title){
  var content=widget.getElement().innerHTML;
  var win = window.open('', 'printWindow', 'height=600,width=800');
  win.document.write('&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;'+title+'/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;');
  win.document.write('&lt;body&gt;'+content+'&lt;/body&gt;');
  win.document.close(); 
  win.focus(); 
  win.print();
  win.close();
}  
</code></pre>

<p>and the onclick handler for the button is:</p>

<pre><code>print(widget.root.descendants.PageFragment1, 'test');
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, PageFragment1 is a page fragment on the current page, hidden by adding a style with name<code>hidden</code> with definition <code>.hidden{display:none;}</code> (this is different than visible which in App Maker seems to remove the item from the DOM). Works perfectly...</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> You cannot open pages from the app in another tab. In principle something like this would do it:</p>

<pre><code>var w=window.parent.parent;
w.open(w.location.protocol+'//'+w.location.host+w.location.pathname+'#PrintPage', '_blank');
</code></pre>

<p>But since the app is running in frame nested two deep from the launching page, and with a different origin, you will not be able to access the url that you need (the above code results in a cross origin frame access error). So you would have to hard code the URL, which changes at deployment, so it gets ugly very fast. Not that you want to anyway, the load time of an app should discourage you from wanting to do that anyway.</p>

<p>But this didn't solve my issue. While I wasn't getting any errors, my emails were still not working through Zoho so I found another solution that works perfectly for my needs...</p>

<p>1) Connect Zoho to gmail using SMTP. I setup my zoho email as an alias for my personal gmail account so zoho emails are forwarded to gmail and I can reply to them IN gmail FROM my zoho email address. This should be done anyways so you never have to login to zoho. Just do all emailing from gmail.</p>

<p>2) Connect ActionMailer to gmail account NOT zoho.</p>

<pre><code>config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
    :address                          =&gt; 'smtp.gmail.com',
    :port                                 =&gt; 587,
    :user_name                     =&gt; ENV[""gmail_username""],
    :password                       =&gt; ENV[""gmail_password""],
    :authentication                =&gt; :plain,
    :enable_starttls_auto     =&gt; true
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I just need to specify the to and from values in the mailer like so:</p>

<pre><code>def notify_admin (message_details)
    @message_details = message_details
    mail(to: ""jesse@mydomain.com"", subject: ""Contact form filled out by: "" + message_details[:name], from: message_details[:email])
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works when I want to send emails to myself as is the example above when someone submits the contact form.</p>

<p>It ALSO works when I want to send an email from my domain such as when they fill out the lead magnet. All I did was  switch the to: and from: addresses. </p>

(The rough summary is you in the ""onSave"" for your record, you need to query for the record with the current highest ID, and add to it.

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In App Settings, under External Resources, add JavaScript URL: <code>https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js</code></li>
<li><p>The client script should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>function showChart(widget){
    google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['timeline']});
    function drawChart() {
       var container = widget.getElement();
       var chart = new google.visualization.Timeline(container);
       var dataTable = new google.visualization.DataTable();
       dataTable.addColumn({ type: 'string', id: 'President' });
       dataTable.addColumn({ type: 'date', id: 'Start' });
       dataTable.addColumn({ type: 'date', id: 'End' });
       dataTable.addRows([
          [ 'Washington', new Date(1789, 3, 30), new Date(1797, 2, 4) ],
          [ 'Adams',      new Date(1797, 2, 4),  new Date(1801, 2, 4) ],
          [ 'Jefferson',  new Date(1801, 2, 4),  new Date(1809, 2, 4) ]]);
      chart.draw(dataTable);
    }
    google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that Google uses non-standard Javascript, where it is required that methods be declared before they are used, so the <code>setOnLoadCallback</code> must take place after the declaration of <code>drawChart</code>. Also note the use of <code>widget.getElement()</code> to get a DOM object from an App Maker widget.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Add an HTML widget to a page, give it the desired width and height, and on its <code>onAttach</code> event, add a call to <code>showChart(widget);</code></li>

Maybe you can try to get the parent element of the one who's dynamically changing it's ID and then use some other attribute as it's class or tag name to get it.</p>

<p>I know your question is about node but I'll make an example in java because is the one I've tried Selenium with and I think that the idea is what is useful for you here.<br><br>
i.e. for the following HTML assuming that you have a <em>div</em> element as a parent of your <em>input</em> element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""myDiv""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""inputText115:3551;a""&gt;

<p>you can do some navigation through it's parent element like this:</p>

<pre><code>WebElement parentElement = driver.findElement(By.id(""myDiv""));
parentElement.findElement(By.tagName(""input"")).click(); //here you're clicking the element with the changing ID

I recently used most of the UI and logic of this template and I was able to integrate it with SQL data models and it works really great. </p>

<p>I noticed that for this template they are saving the (widget.datasource.item._key) to a Page custom property which you can access afterwards. Custom properties are page-level properties that store data for a single user session. Custom properties are useful when you need to bind properties of multiple widgets to a single value. More info available here <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/binding#custom_properties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/binding#custom_properties</a></p>

<p>In your scenario, you can create a new custom property (string) inside your ProjectInfoPage and then you can add a script to the button onClick event in your ProjectPage to save the _key or any other item to a page property. For example:</p>

<pre><code>app.pages.ProjectInfoPage.properties.ProjectKey = widget.datasource.item._key;
app.showDialog(app.pages.ProjectInfoPage);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can get the ‚ÄúProjectKey‚Äù property by adding this to the onAttach event in your ProjectInfoPage:</p>

<pre><code>var key = app.pages.ProjectInfoPage.properties.ProjectKey;
‚Ä¶
</code></pre>

<p>In the onAttach event you can filter the new model or pass the property values to a server script. I believe there are other approaches but I hope this helps!</p>

You could use SQL server, Dynamics 365, SP, Azure, and in the future there will be an SDK for the Common Data Service. There are a lot of connectors, and Powershell can work with a good majority of them.</p>

<p>Take note that working with these data structures through Powershell is independent from Powerapps. Powerapps just takes the data that the data connector gives it, and if you have something updating the data in the background (Powershell, cron job, etc.), In order to get a dynamic list of items, you can use a Timer control and a Refresh function on your data source to update the list every ~5-20 seconds.</p>

<p>To your second question about SharePoint, there is an article that came out around the time you asked this regarding working with large lists. I wouldn't say it completely solves your question, but <a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-now-supports-working-with-more-than-256-items-in-sharepoint-lists/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> seems to state using the ""Filter"" function on basic column types would possibly work for you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...if you‚Äôd like to filter the set of items that you are showing in the gallery control, you will make use of a ‚ÄúFilter‚Äù expression, rather than the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù expression, which is the default that existing apps used. With our changes, SharePoint connector now supports ‚Äúequals‚Äù type of queries on columns that support filtering (Single line of text, choice, numbers, dates and people), so make sure that the columns and the expressions you use are supported and watch for the same warning to avoid reverting back to the top 500 items. </p>

<p>The biggest trick here is how does the first page fragment tell the second to open? That ends up being simple, just add a custom boolean property to the first fragment. Then in the base page (which contains the two fragments) bind the visible property of the second fragment to the custom property of the first fragment. Then in the first fragment, you can set that property to ""true"" when you want the second fragment to show, and ""false"" when you want it to hide.</p>

<p>Some useful information can be found here:<br>
<a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/working-with-variables/#create-a-collection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/working-with-variables/#create-a-collection</a><br>
<a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/function-clear-collect-clearcollect/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/tutorials/function-clear-collect-clearcollect/</a></p>

<p>Based off of your flow, let's assume that the screens are named as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Screen1 will be ""SpecifyLocation""  </li>
<li>Screen2 will be ""SpecifyAction""  </li>
<li>Screen3 will be ""FinalizeInput""</li>
</ul>

<p>The names are arbitrary, but I think they'll make the following example easier to follow.</p>

<p>On the screen <code>""SpecifyLocation""</code>, we're going to create four buttons. They will all be identical, except for the name of the location they reference. For instance, the button referencing ""NY"" would be as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><code>Text = ""New York""</code>  </li>
<li><code>OnSelect = ClearCollect( LocationMetadata, ""NY"" ); Navigate(SpecifyAction,ScreenTransition.Cover)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the <code>OnSelect</code> value is two different functions separated by a semicolon. The first function, <code>ClearCollect()</code>, clears all information in a collection and then writes a new entry. In this case, we have a collection named <code>LocationMetadata</code> into which we are writing the value <code>""NY""</code>. The second function, <code>Navigate()</code>, changes which screen we are looking at.</p>

<p>On the screen <code>""SpecifyAction""</code>, we're going to create two buttons. They will be similar, except for the action they refer to. For instance, the button referencing ""Add"" would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Text = ""Add""</code>  </li>
<li><code>OnSelect = ClearCollect( ActionMetadata, ""Add"" ); Navigate(FinalizeInput,ScreenTransition.Cover)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As was the case before, we've created a button that calls two functions when clicked. They are the same two functions as last time; however, we've changed <code>LocationMetadata</code> to <code>ActionMetadata</code> in our <code>ClearCollect()</code> call, since we want to store a different piece of information. We've also changed our <code>Navigate()</code> call to move us over to the <code>""FinalizeInput""</code> screen.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how you've got your final screen laid out, but in any case, you'll want to access the data we stored in collections previously. This can be done with the function <code>First()</code>, which returns the first element of a collection.</p>

<p>To access our selected location, you can use: <code>First(LocationMetadata).Value</code><br>
To access our selected action, you can use: <code>First(ActionMetadata).Value</code></p>

<p>You should be able to supplement whatever extra data is collected from your user on this final screen with the collections we set up.</p>

The issue here was that the accounts which did not work have the ""Viewer"" role in the IAM &amp; Admin section of the Google Cloud SQL project. The Viewer role gives (among other permissions) read access to Cloud SQL, but not write access.</p>

<p>The best role to use if restricted access is required, but they need full access to read/write SQL, is the Google Cloud SQL Client role.

<p>Thanks for Juan for help tracking all this down.</p>

<p>Edit: It's also worth mentioning that the reason this works in the Editor, but not in Preview/Deployments is the editor is explicitly whitelisted for access (as one of the steps we ask you to do in the documentation), so it doesn't use role permissions for a particular account, while access through your deployments is not explicitly whitelisted in this way, so role permissions are enforced.</p>

<p>That's great. Perl is very powerful and suitable for (nearly) <strong>any</strong> task.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not very concise code. It is probably a legacy code from an Excel or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BASIC</a> person. Some comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>the code doing the <em>same</em> actions for every field. So, why do you need the <code>if</code> statemenents?</li>
<li>Also, why need break each <code>print</code> into 3 separate <code>print</code>s?</li>
<li>why do you need the <code>|</code> at the beginning of the line?</li>
<li>you probably want to close <code>MYFILE</code> instead of the <code>LOGFILE</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>others</p>

<ul>
<li>it is strange to print to every cell the <code>field_name: field_value</code>, instead of create the column header, but YMMV - so maybe you need this.</li>
<li>it is better to use lexical filehandles, like <code>$myfile</code> instead of the <code>MYFILE</code></li>
<li>the <code>foreach</code> could be written as <code>for</code> :)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
but I am not getting right format I want, any thoughts?
</blockquote>

<p>i'm unable to tell anything about the <strong>your wanted format</strong>, mainly because:</p>

<ul>
<li>you didn't said anything about what format do you want to get</li>
<li>and, unfortunately, my crystal globe is on the scheduled maintenance. :)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
Or if there is another language easier to interact with Quickbase?
</blockquote>

<p>Probably <strong>not</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The quickbase has an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API</a> for the access, (you <a href=""https://help.quickbase.com/api-guide/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can learn about it here</a>, and every language (using some libraries) just does the bridge. For the perl it is the <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::QuickBase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTP::QuickBase</a> module. Did you read the doc?</li>
<li>Perl is extremely powerful, so anyone can write very concise code. Just need learn the language (as any other one). (Unfortunately, I'am also closer to  beginners as experts.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above code is could be reduced to:</p>

<pre><code>for my $record ($qdb-&gt;doQuery($dbid,""{0.CT.''}"",""6.7.8.9"")) {
    print MYFILE '|',
                 join('|', map {
                           '""' . $_ . ': ' . $_-&gt;{field} . '""'
                      } keys %$record
                  ), ""\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>And will do exactly as the above.</p>

<p>But need to tell, it is still wrong solution. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>need cope with the <em>quoting</em> e.g. the <code>""cell content""</code>.</li>
<li>but also, the cell contents could contain also the <code>""</code> character, so you need espace them. Here are more escaping techniques for the <code>CSV</code> files, one of is doubling the quote character (usually the <code>""</code>). Or prepend them with <code>\</code>. And much more possible problems, like ""new line"" characters <code>\n</code> in the cells and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid <code>CSV</code> quoting/escaping hell and other possible problems with CSV generation, you should to use the <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::CSV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Text::CSV</a> module. It's been developed in the last 20 years, so it is very long time/hard/stress tested module. You could to use it as:</p>

<pre><code>use Text::CSV;
use autodie;

my $csv = Text::CSV-&gt;new ( { sep_char =&gt; '|', binary =&gt; 1 } ) #if you really want use the '|' instead of the standard comma.
               or die ""Cannot use CSV: "".Text::CSV-&gt;error_diag ();
open $fh, '&gt;', 'some.csv';
$csv-&gt;print( $fh, [map { $_-&gt;{field} } keys %$_]) for @$records;
close $fh;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the code is not tested. So, what next?</p>

<ul>
<li>learn about the <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::QuickBase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quickbase API module</a></li>
<li>learn about and install the <a href=""https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::CSV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Text::CSV</a> module</li>
<li>read some tutorials and docs about the Perl language itself.</li>

<p>If you've already got an Apps Script script, then this should be easy. What you probably want to do is implement a Calculated Model in order to get the results from BigQuery to your application. In short, a Calculated model will let you define a custom schema, and then write Apps Script code to query BigQuery and then create, fill, and return records (which will be very similar to the code you wrote to fill sheets). Once you've done this you can use the calculated model like you would a normal SQL or Drive Tables model.</p>

<p>That problem is solved in 2 steps</p>

<p>1: You need to convert what ever you want to pipe in gulp to a vinyl file.
This can be done like so</p>

<pre><code>const Vinyl = require('vinyl');
var vinyl = new Vinyl();
vinyl.cwd = '/';
vinyl.base = '/';
vinyl.path = '/yourfictivefilepath';
vinyl.contents = new Buffer(JSON.stringify(yourobject));

<p>I think you might have the same problem I had and that is using the correct namespace. If you created a hello component try including it in your app as <code>&lt;hello:hello/&gt;</code></p>

<p>In Salesforce it the namespace seems to default to ""c""</p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;c:component_name&gt; / &lt;c:app_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Below I'll explain how I understand the namespace to work, and you should play with this to get your component working:</p>

<p>src</p>

<p>src/main</p>

<p>src/main/webapp</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/components</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/helloWorld &lt;- this is the namespace</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/helloWorld/helloWorld &lt;- this nested folder is the component for the ""helloWorld"" namespace</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/helloWorld/helloWorld/helloWorld.app </p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/hello &lt;- different namespace</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/hello/hello &lt;- don't forget this component folder for the hello namespace</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/hello/hello/hello.cmp</p>

<p><strong>helloWorld.app</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;aura:application&gt;
    hello web, from the Aura sample app helloWorld
    &lt;hello:hello/&gt;
&lt;/aura:application&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>hello.cmp</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;aura:component&gt;
    Hello, HTML!
&lt;/aura:component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you want everything in the same name space all you need to do is make sure you have the folder structure correct:</p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/helloWorld/helloWorld/helloWorld.app </p>

<p>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/helloWorld/hello/hello.cmp </p>

<p>Now you can use
<code>&lt;helloWorld:helloWorld/&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;helloWorld:hello/&gt;</code></p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>you just have put a null check on each field and u r good to go.</p>

<p>you can generate the inv_number on the time of bulk uploading also by adding null check in the same code on and placing the code on Add> On Submt.( just the part inside the loop )</p>

 year field as string.else you would have to user Year.tostring().substring(2,4) &amp; instead of if(Year=="""","""",...) you have to put if(Year==null , null,...);</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(BrowseScreen1,ScreenTransition.Fade,{SelectedStore: Dropdown1.Selected.Value})

<p>Now, lets update the function in the Items property for your gallery so it filters by StoreNum, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Sort(Filter(If(IsBlank(TextSearchBox1.Text), Products, Filter(Products, TextSearchBox1.Text in Text(ItemNameWeight))), SelectedStore = StoreNum), ItemNameWeight, Ascending)

<p>I think the reason you aren't seeing the Database B (relation) option anymore is we only show that if the inherited data source is Database A. As all relation data sources need a parent data source to be based on (that's how they know to which item to show relations for). So for your case, the solution is probably to set the data source of the entire page to Database A, then go to set the relation accordion's data source, now you should see Database B(relation).</p>

<p>Sometimes you really just want to specify the relation datasource directly rather than have it be based on the parent, in this case you can click ""advanced"" in the data source chooser, and choose the relation specifically. I think the path in this case is something like:</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use the HTML widget to create an upload form. Apps Script has a cool bit of functionality that if you pass a form with a file upload element in it to the server, then it sends the blob of the uploaded form to the server script.

<p>Create an html widget, click ""Allow unsafe HTML"" (because we're adding a script to the HTML) and then add this html to it:</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong></p>

<p>You can duplicate Directory fields you need in your tables.</p>

<p><em>>> is there a way to use Sheets as a Datasource and accomplish the same thing?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The easiest way to use spreadsheet is importing data to your model,
but afaik it is one-time manual operation.</li>
<li>In theory you can implement synchronization algorithm that will sync
your model(s) with some sheet(s) and setup a trigger to call it...
sounds too complex to me...I would not recommend to move in this
direction, unless you have no other options.</li>
<li>Another option with spreadsheets is creating Calculated Model and using App Script Spreadsheet API to pull/push data:</li>

var subject = widgets.Subject.value;
var msg = widgets.Msg.value;
widgets.EmailStatus.text = 'Sending email...';

<pre><code>function  clearEmailForm(){
  var formWidgets = app.pages.Basic.descendants;
  formWidgets.EmailStatus.text = """";
  formWidgets.Msg.value = """";
  formWidgets.To.value = """";

   clearEmailForm();
    })

I agree generally that if you want to generate multiple records programmatically, you generally end up going with embedded javascript. That being said,  two potential alternatives:</p>

<p><em>Possible</em></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>QuickBase Actions</strong> - if you're guaranteed to have a record modification (or can force one), then you can use the new QuickBase actions to generate a child record. This is a longer shot, but would be nice if you've got </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Better</em></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p><strong>Editable Embedded Forms</strong> - you've mentioned using the grid edit function to add records. If you're open to using grid edit functionality, what you could do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a new form for employees, which displays only information you want them to view / edit while doing a compensation review</p></li>
<li><p>Create an report on the compensation history table which shows the subset of records for an employee you want them to see when adding a new record</p>

<ul>
<li>embed this report on the form you created above, marking it as ""editable""</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a button for the ""employees up for review report"" which takes you to the employee's record, and the form you created above</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I think editable embedded forms are probably the way to go to get closest to your workflow without custom scripting. That way, a manager can create new records without either the add button or custom scripts. Yeah, it's another click, but a) you can show them other info you'd want them to take into consideration when filling it in, and b) it avoids the custom scripting.</p>

<p>The solution will be to pass to through2 options, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>return through.obj({highWaterMark: 32}, function (file: any, encoding: any, callback: any) {

<li>highWaterMark (defaults to 16)</li>

<p>It shows how to create a data query with a filter, which is basically what you need for that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Filtering out columns is a bit tougher, at least I haven't figured an easy way to do it yet. </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Out there, there are probably solutions that are much better than this one. This is just to give you a thought.</strong></p>

<p>I've solved this problem by using a custom property List named 'isVisible' for the page the table is in. Then I've added a multi select named 'ColumnPicker' into the page.</p>

<p>After each change in the ColumnPicker, I sync the changes with isVisible. Each column's visibility (for both header and data parts) are connected to:
<code>@widget.root.properties.isVisible[@widget.childIndex]</code></p>

<p>So using the widget's index, I relate it to the isVisible list.</p>

<p>Here's the sync function I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>  function syncColumnPickerValuesWithIsVisible(columnPickerWidget, newValues) {
    setIsVisibleAllSameValue(columnPickerWidget, false);
    newValues.forEach(function(element) {
      columnPickerWidget.root.properties.isVisible[element] = true;
    });
  }
</code></pre>

<p>So in the sync, I first set all isVisible values to false. Then I use the newValues array that the multi select provides to set the correct isVisible elements as true.</p>

<p>=> Items selected from the multi select are shown as columns in the table.</p>

I have even written a SQL script that refreshed these views, depending on the MDS metadata and settings stored in the warehouse. Unfortunately, I don't have it around anymore, but it's all quite transparent there.</p>

<p>Everything was very much alive. Can't recall any problems with queries that involved these MDS views.</p>

<p>Using the Excel plugin to import data into MDS, and then expose the data to another system can work, considering the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Volume of data. The excel plugin handles large volumes in batches. So the process can become tedious.</li>
<li>Model setup. You need to configure the model properly with the Entities and Attributes well defined. The MDS architecture is 'pseudo data warehouse' where the entities can be considered 'facts' and the domain based attributes 'dimensions'. This is an oversimplification of the system but once you define a model you will understand what I mean.</li>

<p>from OnClick event, without ever defining <em>to</em>, <em>subject</em> or <em>body</em>. Instead, when trying to pass something from a widget to client script, you should use something like:</p>

}

  Uploading files using this component is subject to regular Apex controller limits, which is 1 MB. To accommodate file size increase due to base64 encoding, we recommend that you set the maximum file size to 750 KB. You must implement chunking for file size larger than 1 MB. Files uploaded via chunking are subject to a size limit of 4 MB.</p>

45368552,2,,45363366,2017-07-28T08:28:58.253,,1,,"<p>one way you can accomplish this is by passing the data to Custom Properties defined in your Page Fragment and then you can place those properties to the corresponding fields. I recommend you also check this article <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/viewfragments#use_custom_properties_to_customize_page_fragments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/viewfragments#use_custom_properties_to_customize_page_fragments</a></p>

<p>First you need to create the Custom Properties inside your Page Fragment. Then in your Copy button onClick event you can use something like this to save the row data from your table to the Custom Properties:</p>

<pre><code>var rowDataSource = widget.datasource.item._key;
app.datasources.SystemOrders.selectKey(rowDataSource);

var projectName = app.datasources.SystemOrders.item.project_name;
var deliveryInfo = app.datasources.SystemOrders.item.delivery_info;
//...
app.pageFragments.SystemOrders_Edit.properties.ProjectName = projectName;
app.pageFragments.SystemOrders_Edit.properties.DeliveryInfo = deliveryInfo;
//...
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.SystemOrders_Edit);
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you have a form inside your Page Fragment, you can bind the value of each field with custom properties. Binding will ensure that the data is pre-populated. This can be done for each field via the Property Editor and the binding should look like this: @properties.ProjectName</p>

<p>Inside your Submit button onClick event you can use something like this to create a new item in the datasource using the values available in each field. </p>

<pre><code>var projectName = widget.root.descendants.Field1.value;
var deliveryInfo = widget.root.descendants.Field2.value;
//...

var myDatasource = app.datasources.SystemOrders_HideComplete;
var myCreateDatasource = myDatasource.modes.create;
var draft = myDatasource.modes.create.item;

   draft.project_name = projectName;
   draft.delivery_info = deliveryInfo;
   //...

   // Create the new item
   myCreateDatasource.createItem();

app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>You can set properties back to null once item is created (maybe onDetach) like this:
app.pageFragments.SystemOrders_Edit.properties.ProjectName = null;</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

That said, I think a simple type-class based dispatch based on type is simpler here (since the constraints are non-trivial). With all of the right extensions enabled [1], you just need:</p>

<pre><code>class Tuplify a where
  tuplify :: a -&gt; [(String, String)]

instance Tuplify (Rec Identity '[]) where
  tuplify RNil = []

instance (Show t, KnownSymbol s, Tuplify (Rec Identity rs)) =&gt;
           Tuplify (Rec Identity (s :-&gt; t ': rs)) where
  tuplify (v :*: rs) = (symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy s), show v) : tuplify rs
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in GHCi:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; tuplify ab
[(""a"",""\""A\""""),(""b"",""1"")]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you really want to try the reifying constraint approach, you'll have to start by declaring a type class and instance for the particular constraint you want:</p>

<pre><code>class ShowField a where 
  showField :: a -&gt; (String, String)                                                                                

instance (KnownSymbol s, Show a) =&gt; ShowField (Identity (s :-&gt; a)) where
  showField (Identity (Val v)) = (symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy s), show v)
</code></pre>

<p>Then it becomes more straightforward to use <code>reifyConstraints</code> and <code>rmap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tuplify' :: RecAll Identity rs ShowField =&gt; Rec Identity rs -&gt; [(String, String)]
tuplify' xs = recordToList
            . rmap (\(Vinyl.Compose (Dict x)) -&gt; Vinyl.Const $ showField x)
            $ reifyConstraint (Proxy :: Proxy ShowField) xs
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine something similar is possible with <code>reifyDicts</code>, although I wish there was a variant of it defined using <code>ValuesAllHave</code> instead of just <code>AllHave</code> (then we could bypass declaring a <code>ShowField</code> typeclass and do everything in just a function).</p>

<p>First I had to create a <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/directory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directory Model</a>. </p>

<p>Then under the App Settings section for the app itself (click the gear) I put the following code under the <strong>App Startup Script - Client Script</strong> section: </p>

<pre><code>loader.suspendLoad();
app.datasources.CurrentUser.load({
  success: function() {
    loader.resumeLoad();
  },
  failure: function(error) {
   // TODO: Handle error
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Next I went under the Datasources section for the Directory model and added a datasource called CurrentUser. </p>

<p>In the <strong>Query - Server Script</strong> section I put: </p>

<pre><code>var query = app.models.Directory.newQuery();

query.filters.PrimaryEmail._equals = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();

return query.run();
</code></pre>

<p>This filters the datasource so that the only entry in there is the current user. Then I adjusted my ""var fullName"" in the email Client Script to point to the new datasource: </p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Calls a server method to send an email.
 * @param {Widget} sendButton - widget that triggered the action.
 */
function newSalesEmailMessage(sendButton) {
  var pageWidgets = sendButton.root.descendants;
  var fullName = app.datasources.CurrentUser.item.FullName;
  var htmlbody = '&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=""3""&gt;' + fullName + '&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;' + ' has created a new sales entry for: ' +  
      '&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=""color:#2196F3""&gt;' +pageWidgets.ProjectName.value  + '&lt;/h1&gt;' +
      '&lt;p&gt;Contact: &lt;b&gt;' + pageWidgets.Contact.value + '&lt;/b&gt;' +      
      '&lt;p&gt;Sales Person: &lt;b&gt;' + pageWidgets.SalesPerson.value + '&lt;/b&gt;' +
      '&lt;p&gt;Notes: &lt;b&gt;' + pageWidgets.Notes.value + '&lt;/b&gt;';


  google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(function() {
     })
    .withFailureHandler(function(err) {
      console.error(JSON.stringify(err));
    })
    .sendEmailCreate(
      'test@email.com',
      'New Sales Entry for: ' + pageWidgets.ProjectName.value,
      htmlbody);
}

<p>Note that the Drive Picker has special properties which are available in the Property Editor.

<p>I believe there are other ways but I was able to do a simple integration by creating an App with a datasource that has 3 fields (one of the fields will be for the PDF URL). I added a simple ‚ÄúInsert Form‚Äù into a Page and I placed the Drive Picker inside the Insert Form. Then I used the ‚ÄúselectedDocUrl‚Äù property and using bindings I simply assign it to my @datasource.item.pdf_link. Check image below:

I was able bind the ‚Äúhref‚Äù property of the Link widget to the @datasource.item.pdf_link. Upon clicking the Link icon, is simply opens a new Tab with the Drive PDF viewer and users can easily view or even download the pdf file. This is an output of the app:

  <p>how do you access datasources from a server script?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The link you provided points to server-side API, but there are no datasources on server(datasources exist only on client side). Of course, you can create records on server, but to see them you need to reload datasource on client side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So it appears that newRecord is not a function at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most obvious answer will be that you are trying to call Sever Side API on the client(make sure, you selected right script type when created)...</p>

<p>If you actually want to create new record on the client side, then you need to go with datasource's create mode:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Create a new record for datasource in auto-save mode

<p>In auto save mode App Maker instantly saves every field, so you have per-field saving granularity. In other words, whenever field's value is changed App Maker sends request to server to save the modification.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// this code will trigger async call to server to save the modification
// only for this particular field.
app.datasources.MyDatasource.item.MyField = 'My new value';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Manual Save Mode</strong></p>

<p>With manual save mode there is no easy way to save modifications subsets separately, since whenever you call 'saveChanges' method App Maker will try to persist all modifications made to the datasource. Here are some pretty bad workarounds that <strong>I would not recommend</strong> unless you have no other options:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Implementation with callback chaining if field save
// order matters. It will work extremely slow.
var ds = app.datasources.MyDatasource; 
ds.item.MyField1 = 'My new value 1';

ds.saveChanges(function() {
  ds.item.MyField2 = 'My new value 2';

  ds.saveChanges(function() {
    ds.item.MyField3 = 'My new value 3';
    ...  
  });
});


// Implementation without chaining. In theory should work
// faster(if it would work at all...)
var ds = app.datasources.MyDatasource;

ds.item.MyField1 = 'My new value 1';
ds.saveChanges();

ds.item.MyField2 = 'My new value 2';
ds.saveChanges();

ds.item.MyField3 = 'My new value 3';
ds.saveChanges();
...  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Server Script</strong></p>

<p>Pretty much same answer as for Manual Save mode, it is doable, but <strong>I would not recommend do it</strong> since performance will significantly degrade.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>record.MyField1 = 'My new value 1';
app.saveRecords([record]);

record.MyField2 = 'My new value 2';

<p>I tried to use App Script Execution API with App Maker and here are my findings:</p>

<li><p>You can enable Execution API for App Maker app deployment in Google Cloud Console, just go to Settings -> Deployments -> Select deployment -> View Logs (these steps will navigate you to associated Cloud Project), then follow <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/rest/quickstart/js#step_1_turn_on_the_api_name"" rel=""noreferrer"">these instructions</a> to enable API itself and create credentials:

<li><p>Next goes deal breaker for combining App Maker and Execution API... To use App Script app as API you need to deploy it as 'API executable', but App Maker publishes its deployments as 'web app'... I'm not sure, if one can have App Script app simultaneously published both as 'web app' and 'API executable', but even if it is possible App Maker doesn't allow you do it at this time.</p></li>

<p>In case you don't want to use Cloud SQL and want to go with <strong>Drive Tables</strong> you can emulate unique constraint manually using locks, queries and model events:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// onCreate model event (actually it is onBeforeCreate)
// this events accepts about-to-create record as parameter
var lock = LockService.getScriptLock();
lock.waitLock(5000);

query.filters.SomeField._equals = record.SomeField;

var records = query.run();

if (records.length &gt; 0) {
  throw new Error('Record with SomeField value equal to ' + record.SomeField +
                   ' already exists.');
}

lock.releaseLock();

<p>You can toggle nested items by toggling CSS class:</p>

One is to disable the dropdown whenever there is no selection in the radio buttons - this way the user will know that they have to do something with it. You can do it by setting the <code>DisplayMode</code> property in your dropdown control to this:</p>

<pre><code>If(IsBlank(Radio1.Selected.Value), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)
</code></pre>

<p>Another option is to have a couple of controls, the dropdown and a label (with a message ""please select a value"") positioned on top of each other. Then you can toggle the visibility of the controls depending on whether there is a selection in the radio buttons or not.</p>

<p>Yet another option is to define a table with the same schema as the collection you want to display in the dropdown that has only 1 value (with something like ""Select Product"", and use an If condition in the Items property to select between that collection and your filtered one. One way to do that is to initialize such collection when the screen is loaded (in the OnVisible property):</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(defaultDemands, Defaults(Demands));
Clear(defaultDemands);
Patch(defaultDemands, Defaults(Demands), {Name:""Select Product""})
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the expression creates a collection with an ""empty"" version of the demand (thus copying the schema to the new collection). The second clears it, and the third one adds a new item where the name is what you want displayed. Then in the Items property of the dropdown you can choose between the two collections depending on the state of the radio selection:</p>

<p><strong>1. I created two Google Drive Table models: PORequests and Items.</strong></p>

<p>PORequests has fields like: PORequest Number, Vendor and the Total*.</p>

<p>*Note: The Total field had to be a String and not a number.</p>

<p>Items has fields like: ItemName, Quantity, Cost and Subtotal.</p>

<p><strong>2. I created a ONE to MANY relationship with the two datasources (PORequests as the owner).</strong> </p>

<p><strong>3. I created a page with two Tables.</strong> </p>

<p>Table 1's datasource = PORequests
Table 2's datasource = PORequests: Items (relation)*</p>

<p>This way if I click PORequest #1 in Table 1 I only see Items associated with that POR.</p>

<p>*Note: I set the Subtotal field to ""non-editable/label"", so no one accidentally changes it manually.</p>

<p><strong>4. Then I created a Client Script:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Locale constant that is used for currency formatting.
 */
var CURRENT_LOCALE = 'en-US';


/**
 * Calculates and formats total cost of all POR items.
 * @param {Array&lt;CartItem&gt;} PORItems - list of user's POR items.
 * @return {string} formatted total cost of all POR items.
 */
function getSubtotalTotal(PORItems) {
    var cost = PORItems.reduce(function(result, item) {
    return result + item.Subtotal;
  }, 0);
  var total = cost + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Tax + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Shipping;
  return '$' + total.toLocaleString(CURRENT_LOCALE, {minimumFractionDigits: 2});
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5. Then I set the onValueEdit for the Quantity and Cost fields to:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>widget.datasource.item.Subtotal = widget.datasource.item.Quantity * widget.datasource.item.Cost;

var subtotalTotal = getSubtotalTotal(app.datasources.PORequests.relations.Items.items);
app.datasources.PORequests.item.Total = subtotalTotal;
</code></pre>

<p>This tells App Maker to first: multiply the cost by the quantity and put that value in the Subtotal field.</p>

<p>Then it tells App Maker to: use the getSubtotalTotal script to add all the Subtotal values and put THAT value in the Total field of the PORequest datasource.</p>

<p>Hope all that helps someone in the future. </p>

However, you can create a datasource parameter or a page parameter of type List and set your grid datasource equal to this parameter. Then you can use client scripts to manipulate the datasource and read or write it back to your datasource field using string to object conversions and using object to string conversions, however your field must have a string separator like a comma or similar that is used as a parser when converting between string and object.

<p>I have a calculated model that is all of the user's contacts from Google Contacts (full name, email, mobile, etc...) On the UI I have a list widget that's populated with all of the Full Name fields and above the list widget a text input that's used to search the list widget. So the search text box's on input change event sends a request to query the Full Names, similar to how Google Contact's search feature works.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmLkA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Screen Shot</a></p>

<p>It appears that App Maker doesn't let you query calculated models, so I have this workaround - unless someone comes up with something better:</p>

<p>This is the onInputChange handler for the search text box:</p>

<pre><code>sq = app.pages.SelectClient.descendants.TextBox1.value;
app.datasources.SearchContacts.query.parameters.Name = sq;
app.datasources.SearchContacts.load();
</code></pre>

<p>This is the Server Script Code (thanks to @Pavel Shkleinik for the heads up):</p>

<pre><code>var sq = query.parameters.Name;

if (sq !== null) {
 return getContactsbyName(sq);

} else {

return getContacts();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the server code with no query:</p>

<pre><code>function getContacts() {

  var results = [];
  var contacts = ContactsApp.getContacts();
  contacts.forEach(function(item) {
    var contact = app.models.Contacts.newRecord();
    contact.FullName = item.getFullName();
    var emails = item.getEmails(ContactsApp.Field.WORK_EMAIL);
    if (emails.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.PrimaryEmail = emails[0].getAddress();
    }
    contact.LastName = item.getFamilyName();
    contact.FirstName = item.getGivenName();
    var phones  = item.getPhones(ContactsApp.Field.MOBILE_PHONE);
    if (phones.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.Mobile = phones[0].getPhoneNumber();
    }
    var addresses = item.getAddresses(ContactsApp.Field.WORK_ADDRESS);
    if (addresses.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.Address = addresses[0].getAddress();
    }
    results.push(contact);
    results.sort();
  });
  return results;

}
</code></pre>

<p>And with the query:</p>

<pre><code>function getContactsbyName(sq) {

var results = [];
  var contacts = ContactsApp.getContactsByName(sq);
  contacts.forEach(function(item) {
    var contact = app.models.Contacts.newRecord();
    contact.FullName = item.getFullName();
    var emails = item.getEmails(ContactsApp.Field.WORK_EMAIL);
    if (emails.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.PrimaryEmail = emails[0].getAddress();
    }
    contact.LastName = item.getFamilyName();
    contact.FirstName = item.getGivenName();
    var phones  = item.getPhones(ContactsApp.Field.MOBILE_PHONE);
    if (phones.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.Mobile = phones[0].getPhoneNumber();
    }
    var addresses = item.getAddresses(ContactsApp.Field.WORK_ADDRESS);
    if (addresses.length &gt; 0) {
    contact.Address = addresses[0].getAddress();
    }
    results.push(contact);
    results.sort();
  });

  return results;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the list populates with all of the names when there's no search query present, and then re-populates with the search query results as needed.</p>

<p>The only issue is that the call to the Google Contacts App to populate the Calculated Model is sometimes very slow.</p>

Of course there are some cases where there is no other way to do it, but this is not the case. Following there is an other solution that use an aura attribute for storing the map.</p>

<p>Attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;aura:attribute name=""map"" type=""Object"" access=""private""/&gt;

<p>Then I recommend you to add call the following code when the component initializes and after the scripts are initialized:</p>

<pre><code>var map = component.get(""v.map"");

//Check if initialized
if(this.isNull(map)){
    map = new L.map('map');
    component.set(""v.map"", map);

<p>To invoke a method on component initialization:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;aura:handler name=""init"" value=""{!this}"" action=""{!c.doInit}"" access=""private"" /&gt;

  google.script.run

I was playing with the Email Sender tutorial and I wanted to collect a list of the emails I'd already sent.  I created the fields and went into the  datasources tab and added this code to the queryRecords() function.</p>

<pre><code>var ss=SpreadsheetApp.openById('id');
var sh=ss.getSheetByName('RecentEmails');
var rg=sh.getRange(2,1,sh.getLastRow(),sh.getLastColumn());

  reRecord.Message=vA[i][2];
  reRecords.push(reRecord);
}
return reRecords;

<p>The above function loads the datasource.</p>

<p>Then I connected a table upto the datasource and the data will update whenever the page is loaded.</p>

<p>I loaded the data into the table with a function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function archiveSentEmails(to,when,what)
{
  var ss=SpreadsheetApp.openById('id');
  var sh=ss.getSheetByName('RecentEmails');
  sh.appendRow([to,when,what]);
}

<p>It gets placed inside the serverside script where the MailApp.sendMail function is located.</p>

<p>When you push the Send EMail button it calls this clientside function which calls the serverside function via google.script.run.</p>

<pre><code>function sendMessage(to, subject, msg){
  var status = app.pages.Email.descendants.EmailStatus;
  google.script.run
   .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
      // An error occurred, so display an error message.
      status.text = error.message;
    })
  .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {

    status.text = 'Email sent...';
    clearEmailForm();
    loadDebugElements();
    app.datasources.RecentEmails.load();//this lines refreshes the widgets attached to the datasource

   })
 .sendEmailMessage(to, subject, msg);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I placed the command <code>app.datasources.RecentEmails.load</code> in the withSuccessHandler so that the table of recent emails will update everytime it sends an email and that way you don't have to have a button to initiate updating the table after every email is sent.</p>

<p>I read your question and thought I'd try to role one of my own and this is what I came up with.  I put all of the buttons on a pageFragment and call it with <code>app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.timePicker2);</code></p>

<p>I only use clientside script.</p>

<pre><code>function updateOutput(){
  var h=app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.hour||'00';
  var m=app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.minute||'00';
  var s=app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.second||'00';
  var t=h + ':' + m + ':' + s;
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.descendants.timeLBL.text=t;
  return t;
}
function updateHour(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.hour=v;
  updateOutput();
}
function updateMinute(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.minute=v;
  updateOutput();
}
function updateSecond(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.properties.second=v;
  updateOutput();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what my time picker looks like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOEAQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOEAQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Yes.  Adding all of the buttons is a nuisance but there are <strong>a few features about AppMaker that make it more tolerable.</strong></p>

<p>First you can assign the TimePicker form properties which I use as global properties.  I had three hour,minute and second.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then after you add all of the hour buttons you can grab all of them at one time by clicking each one while holding down control on a windows machine and click on the onClick event and pick custom action and type this in <code>updateHour(widget.text);</code> the code completion won't give you text as an option but type it any way.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I just figured out how to grab the buttons all a one time by pushing shift and selecting with the mouse</strong></p>

<p>Do the same thing with the minute and second buttons using <code>updateMinute(widget.text)</code> and <code>updateSecond(widget.text);</code> <strong>This saves you a lot of time typing all of the functions into each widget control panel.</strong>  Also you don't have to bother giving all of the buttons special names like I did.  </p>

<p>But you might like to format them with the following css.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zy53e.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zy53e.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And again you can grab all of the buttons at one time and change the following setting:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwDad.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwDad.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>That way you can style all of the buttons at one time.</p>

<p>My save button just copies the final string into a label on the main panel.</p>

<pre><code>app.pages.Testing.descendants.timeLBL2.text=app.pageFragments.TimePicker2.descendants.timeLBL.text;
app.closeDialog();

<p>You will probably want to do something more elegant.</p>

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/LbdN37fDsNE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's a demo:</a> in preview mode.  Sorry about the 24 hour clock.  I always use this for my own stuff because it's so much easier and I like it.  You'll probably want AM &amp; PM. I'll probably go back and do that too.</p>

<p>For an AM/PM Picker I used these functions:</p>

<pre><code>function updateOutputAP(){
  var h=app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.hour||'00';
  var m=app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.minute||'00';
  var s=app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.second||'00';
  var ap=app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.ap||'  ';
  var t=h + ':' + m + ':' + s + ' ' + ap;
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.descendants.timeLBL.text=t;
  return t;
}
function updateHourPM(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.hour=v;
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.ap='PM';
  updateOutputAP();
}
function updateHourAM(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.hour=v;
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.ap='AM';
  updateOutputAP();
}
function updateMinuteAP(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.minute=v;
  updateOutputAP();
}
function updateSecondAP(v){
  app.pageFragments.TimePicker3.properties.second=v;
  updateOutputAP();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what my picker looks like:</p>

<p>The approach to store the individual selected values in separate columns in Table 1 (as you suggest) is not the approach I would recommend.  This is relatively easy to implement but is incomplete and has shortcomings, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to create as many columns as there may be items in Table 2, and the number of items in Table 2 may vary over time</li>
<li>PowerApps cannot currently set a column value to Blank() in a data source, so you will need a work-around to deal with the situation where an item previously selected needs to be unselected</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct way to deal with the combo box is to create a many-to-many relationship as outlined in <a href=""https://baizini-it.com/blog/index.php/2017/10/10/powerapps-101-many-to-many-relationships-between-tables/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a>.</p>

<p>When saving the changes, you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove any records in the junction table where an item has been unselected via a Remove or RemoveIf statement</li>
<li>Create an entry for each new item that has been added to the relationship via a Collect or a Patch function</li>
</ol>

<p>This task is relatively easy. You need to use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated Model</a> to proxy <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/contacts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apps Scripts Contacts API</a> response. Once you create model with subset of fields from the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/contacts/contact"" rel=""noreferrer"">Contact</a> response you can create datasource for the model and bind it to List or Table widget. You can also try to find some inspiration in <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/calculated-model/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated Model Sample</a>.</p>

    record.LastName = contact.getFamilyName();

    var companies = contact.getCompanies();

    if (companies.length &gt; 0) {
      var company = companies[0];

      record.Organization = company.getCompanyName();

      record.Phone = phones[0].getPhoneNumber();
    }

    return record;
  });

  return records;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Create/Update/Delete</strong></p>

<p>Since Calculated Models have some <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated#limitations"" rel=""noreferrer"">limitations</a>, we need to turn on our imagination to create, update and delete records from their datasources. The basic strategy will be <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/reference/run"" rel=""noreferrer"">calling server side scripts</a> for <em>CUD</em> operations in response to user actions on client side. To get user's input from UI we will need to utilize page's <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/binding#custom_properties"" rel=""noreferrer"">Custom Properties</a>, one property for each Contact field:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8j6j.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8j6j.png"" alt=""Custom properties""></a></p>

<p>Here are some snippets that should explain the idea</p>

<p><strong>Create</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// Client script
function onSubmitContactClick(submitButton) {
  var props = submitButton.root.properties;

  var contact = {
    FirstName: props.FirstName,
    LastName: props.LastName,
    Organization: props.Organization,
    ...
  };

  google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(function() {
      // Most likely we'll need to navigate user back to the
      // page with contacts list and reload its datasource
      // to reflect recent changes, because our `CUD` operations
      // are fully detached from the list datasource
      app.showPage(app.pages.Contacts);
      app.datasources.Contacts.load();
     })
    .withFailureHandler(function() {
       // TODO: Handle error
     })
    .createContact(contact);
}


// Server script
function createContact(contactDraft) {
 var contact = ContactsApp.createContact(contactDraft.FirsName,
                                         contactDraft.LastName,
                                         contactDraft.Email);

  contact.addCompany(contactDraft.Organization, contactDraft.Title);
  contact.addPhone(ContactsApp.Field.WORK_PHONE, contactDraft.Phone);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Idea to update contact records will be very similar to the new contact creation flow, so I skip it for now.</p>

<p><strong>Delete</strong></p>

<p>Assuming that delete button is located inside contacts table row.</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// Client script
function onDeleteContactClick(deleteButton) {
  var email = deleteButton.datasource.item.Email;

  google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(function() {
      // To update contacts list we can either reload the entire
      // datasource or explicitly remove deleted item on the client.
      // Second option will work way faster.
      var contactIndex = deleteButton.parent.childIndex;
      app.datasources.Contacts.items.splice(contactIndex, 1);
     })
    .withFailureHandler(function() {
      // TODO: Handle error
     })
    .deleteContact(contact);
}


// Server script
function deleteContact(email) {
  var contact = ContactsApp.getContact(email);
  ContactsApp.deleteContact(contact);
}

48555216,2,,48426028,2018-02-01T04:11:16.377,,2,,"<p>PowerApps is built on JavaScript, which is single threaded (*), based on callbacks. Every expression is executed as a single ""unit of execution"", so if you have something like:</p>

<pre><code>UpdateContext({ a: 1, b: 2 }); UpdateContext({ c: a + b })
</code></pre>

<p>You can count on the fact that the 'a' and 'b' will be initialized together (without being interrupted). You cannot, however, rely on the fact that the second UpdateContext call will be made before anything happens that may change the values of 'a' or 'b' (such as a timer's OnTimerEnd expression) - although it's very unlikely that this will happen.</p>

<p>For the specific example of timers, if you have two of them with this expression:</p>

<pre><code>Set(globalVarA, globalVarA + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible (although quite unlikely, especially for this kind of simple operation) that the value of 'globalVarA + 1' will be calculated for the two timers before the internal implementation of the Set function is called to update the value of that variable (in which case the app would ""lose"" one of the increments).</p>

<p>A scenario where a problem is more likely to happen is when you have calls to data sources (which involve network calls that are slower). For example, if you have this expression on two timers:</p>

<pre><code>Set(oldVar1, var1);
Patch(dataSource, record, changes);
Set(var1, oldVar1 + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Then the likelihood of a race condition happening increases by a lot.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>(*) Currently there is some very limited usage of JS worker threads, so the app isn't technically completely single threaded, but that should not affect expressions that you write.</p>

That would probably take you some time to build. You would also still need to be aware of API limits depending on how many updates are made on the non salesforce side.</p>

<p>In my case I had to change Axis 1.4 using Apache Commons HttpClient as the transport. This involved creating a class implementing interface SecureProtocolSocketFactory. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>package your.package;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.Socket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;

    public TLSv12HttpsSocketFactory( ProtocolSocketFactory base )
    {
        if ( base == null || !(base instanceof SecureProtocolSocketFactory) ) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        this.base = (SecureProtocolSocketFactory) base;
    }

    private Socket acceptOnlyTLS12( Socket socket )
    {
        if ( socket != null &amp;&amp; (socket instanceof SSLSocket) ) {
            ((SSLSocket) socket).setEnabledProtocols( new String[] { TLS_VERSION_1_2 } );
        }

        return socket;
    }

    @Override
    public Socket createSocket( String host, int port ) throws IOException
    {
        return acceptOnlyTLS12( base.createSocket(host, port) );
    }

    @Override
    public Socket createSocket( String host, int port, InetAddress localAddress, int localPort ) throws IOException
    {
        return acceptOnlyTLS12( base.createSocket(host, port, localAddress, localPort) );
    }

    @Override
    public Socket createSocket( String host, int port, InetAddress localAddress, int localPort, HttpConnectionParams params ) throws IOException
    {
        return acceptOnlyTLS12( base.createSocket(host, port, localAddress, localPort, params) );
    }

    @Override
    public Socket createSocket( Socket socket, String host, int port, boolean autoClose ) throws IOException
    {
        return acceptOnlyTLS12( base.createSocket(socket, host, port, autoClose) );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I also had to modify the org.apache.axis.transport.http.CommonsHTTPSender class (generates a few class files when compiled) like this:</p>

<pre><code>// import the new socket factory
import your.package.TLSv12HttpsSocketFactory;
...
// add this at the end of the initialize() method
// setup to our custom TLSv1.2 socket factory
String scheme = ""https"";
Protocol baseHttps = Protocol.getProtocol( scheme );
int defaultPort = baseHttps.getDefaultPort();

ProtocolSocketFactory baseFactory = baseHttps.getSocketFactory();
ProtocolSocketFactory customFactory = new TLSv12HttpsSocketFactory( baseFactory );

Protocol customHttps = new Protocol( scheme, customFactory, defaultPort );
Protocol.registerProtocol( scheme, customHttps );

<p><strong>Large number of widgets to render</strong> (this will cause rendering throttle)</p>

<ul>
<li>Split page into multiple pages</li>

<p><strong>Heavy queries to server or big number of queries</strong></p>

<p>To tune app's performance in this scenario you can try these tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>eagerly load some datasources on app start</li>
<li>Use datasource prefetches for relational data (this easy tweak usually gives huge performance boost)</li>

<p>What you need to do is pass the widget to the <strong>TestFunction</strong> and the <strong>onSuccess</strong> function should go inside the test function. Take into consideration the example below:</p>

<p>App Maker gives you power to connect to <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/cloudsql"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cloud SQL instance</a>, that you can access through <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/quickstart#connect_to_your_instance_using_the_db_client_client_in_the_cloud_shell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cloud Shell</a> or connect with some tools like <a href=""https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MySQL Workbench</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Works nice if you have your own Cloud SQL instance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This approach falls short in environments with shared Cloud SQL instances</li>
<li>Cloud SQL is not free</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Export data to spreadsheet</p>

<p>Regardless what data backend you are using you can <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/import-export#how_you_can_export_data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dump all your data to spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Basically it is one-way data access (read only), unless you want to mess with importing edited data back to your deployemnt...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Drag'n'drop way</p>

<p>There is an option to keep <em>Debug</em> page and drop on it tables/forms for models you want to look it.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Seamless access to data directly from you development environment (browser).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is hard to maintain such <em>Debug</em> especially when you are actively working on your database structure.</li>
<li>Need to think about security and hide the page from your end users.</li>
<li>Need to keep dedicated datasource(s) for the debug tables/forms, that should have no filters applied (at this time there is no client-side analogue of <code>app.models.MyModel.newQuery()</code> server-side API).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> Drag'n'drop way (advanced edition!)</p>

<p>The basic idea is to create a page with dynamic table (to view/edit data) and form (to add records). Using this highly dynamic page will eliminate shortage #1 from the option #3:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJPqS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJPqS.png"" alt=""Editor -&gt; Model""></a>

<p>You need to have a separate datasource for your dropdown. There are at least three techniques to do this:</p>

<p><strong>Possible values</strong></p>

<p>You can predefine <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/fields#use_default_values"" rel=""noreferrer"">allowed values</a> for your <code>Country</code> field and use them to populate drop down options both in create form and table filtering <code>@datasource.model.fields.Country.possibleValues</code> as you mentioned in question:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0fOb.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0fOb.png"" alt=""Possible values""></a></p>

<p><strong>Create model for countries</strong></p>

<p>By introducing dedicated <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/relations"" rel=""noreferrer"">related model</a> for countries you can get the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>normalized data (you will not store the same country multiple times)</li>
<li>you'll be able to keep your countries list clean (with current approach there is possibility to have the same country with different spellings like 'US', 'USA', 'United State', etc)</li>
<li>app users when they create new records will be able to choose the country they need from dropdown (opposed to error prone typing it every time for all new records).</li>
<li>your dropdown bindings will be as simple as these:</li>
</ul>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// for names
@datasources.Countries.items..Names

// for options
@datasources.Countries.items.._key

// for value
@datasource.query.filters.Country._key._equals
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Create Calculated Model</strong></p>

<p>With <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated Model</a> you'll be able to squeeze unique country values from your table. You server query script can look similar to this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>function getUniqueCountries_() {
  var consumptions = app.models.Consumption.newQuery().run();
  var countries = [];

  consumptions.reduce(function (allCountries, consumption) {
    if (!allCountries[consumption.Country]) {
      var country = app.models.CountryCalc.newRecord();
      country.Name = consumption.Country;
      countries.push(country);
      allCountries[consumption.Country] = true;
    }
  }, {});

  return countries;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However with growth of your Consumption table it can give you significant performance overhead. In this case I would rather look into direction of <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/cloudsql"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cloud SQL</a> and <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/cloudsql#sql_calculated_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated SQL model</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>I gave a pretty broad answer that also covers similar situations when number of field options can be unlimited (opposed to limited countries number).</p>

<p>Say for example, you have a model with students data that has three fields; name(string), age(number) and grade(number). On the server script you can write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//define function to do the data export
function dataExport() {

  //create sheet to populate data
  var fileName = ""Students List "" + new Date(); //define file name
  var newExport = SpreadsheetApp.create(fileName); // create new spreadsheet

  newExport.appendRow(header); // append header to spreadsheet

  //get all students records
  var ds = app.models.students.newQuery();

  for(var i=0; i&lt; allStudents.length; i++) {

    //get each student data
    var student = allStudents[i];
    var studentName = student.name;
    var studentAge = student.age;
    var studentGrade = student.grade;

    var newRow = [studentName, studentAge, studentGrade]; //save studen data in a row
    newExport.appendRow(newRow); //append student data row to spreadsheet

  }

  console.log(""Finished Exporting Student Data"");

}

//invoke function to set up the auto export
function exportData(){

  //check if there is an existing trigger for this process

  //if the trigger already exists, inform user about it
  if(existingTrigger) {

    return ""Auto export is already set""; 

  } else { // if the trigger does not exists, continue to set the trigger to auto export data

    //runs the script every day at 1am on the time zone specified
    var newTrigger = ScriptApp.newTrigger('dataExport')
    .timeBased()
    .atHour(1)
    .everyDays(1)

      return ""Auto export has been set successfully!"";
    } else {
      return ""Failed to set auto export. Try again please""; 
    }

  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to delete/stop the auto export, in case you need to, you can write the following on the server script too:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteTrigger() {

  //get the current auto export trigger id
  var triggerId = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(""autoExportTrigger"");

  //get all triggers
  var allTriggers = ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers();

    // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it.
    if (allTriggers[i].getUniqueId() === triggerId) {

      ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(allTriggers[i]);
      break;

      //else delete all the triggers found  
    } else {

      ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(allTriggers[i]);

    }

  }

  PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().deleteProperty(""autoExportTrigger"");
  return ""Auto export has been cancelled"";

}

<p>In case the link dies:</p>

  <p>Well, the short answer is do not delete the db, that will end up losing funds, just like deleting the wallet.dat would in bitcoind.</p>
  
  <p>The long answer is, use newaddr to regenerate all addresses you had (it's ok to call it a few times too many). Then stop lightningd, open lightningd.sqlite3 and tell it to scan from an earlier block:</p>
  
  <p>sqlite3 $HOME/.lightning/lightningd.sqlite3 ""UPDATE vars SET val= 500000 WHERE name='last_processed_block';""</p>
  
  <p>Then restart lightningd and it should start scanning the blocks from height 500'000 (which will take quite some time).</p>
  
  <p>Notice that this only works as long as you don't have channels open, since in that case you're no longer the sole owner of the funds. So never delete the DB!</p>

<p>So, when you drop panel inside form body and drag your input inside that inner panel App Maker CSS rules stop working (the widgets are not direct children of <code>app-FormBody</code> anymore).</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can try to override default App Maker styles</li>
</ul>



<pre><code>/* Note: there is no '&gt;' selector */
.app-FormBody .app-TextBox.required &gt; .app-TextBox-Label:after {
  content: "" *"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what side effects it can potentially cause...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can explicitly add asterisk in binding</p>

<p><code>@models.MyModel.fields.FieldName.displayName + ' *'</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please, also keep in mind that App Maker will not automatically add those hidden styles to the widgets you'll add after form is generated.</p>

The cause of the problem is that App Maker prefixes <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/styles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Global Styles</a> with <code>#app</code>, what breaks your initial variables setup.</p>

 2) Add the following code to the <strong>onClick</strong> event of the button widget:</p>

4) Make sure to check the <strong>allowUnsafeHtml</strong> checkbox <br>
5) Put the following inside the HTML widget html value: <br></p>

<pre><code>&lt;audio id=""audio""&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

<p>If you follow the current instructions written in the Microsoft Docs, you'll end up with an App.config file that contains all the necessary values required to allow you to interact with your CDS Environment. The problem is if you include the user credentials that you would normally be prompted for and change the <code>UserSource</code> value to <code>LoggedIn</code>, you will still be prompted to sign in. Storing the values in the App.config file also doesn't make it ideal for an ASP.NET project.</p>

<p>So what you can do instead is create an instance of the <code>ConnectionSettings</code> class yourself and supply all the necessary credentials.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>var settings = new ConnectionSettings
{
    Credentials = new UserCredentialsSettings
    {
        UserName = _userName,
        Password = _password,
        ApplicationId = _applicationId
    },
    EnvironmendId = _environmentId,
    Tenant = _tenant
};

using (var client = settings.CreateClient().Result)
{
    // Write calls to the CDS here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using this approach will prevent you from getting prompted to sign in. It also allows you to store and access your credentials using <code>ConfigurationManager.AppSettings</code>, making it easy to keep your credentials outside of your source code.</p>

<p>However you can emulate desired behavior with multiple datasources. Let's say we have <code>School</code> (one) and <code>Student</code> (many) models. Given that we can make two queries: one to get the school and other to get students:</p>

<p>The best way I am aware of to get this done (in R) is to wrap a call to a system function. I personally use <a href=""https://lftp.yar.ru/lftp-man.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>lftp</code></a>, which has good handling for:</p>

<ul>
<li>FTPS</li>
<li>Multiple files in/out</li>
<li>Regex and wildcard file naming</li>
</ul>

<p>This does have the downside of being hardware specific; it's not all nicely contained in R. That said, it <em>can</em> potentially save you a lot of time by leveraging tools which are good at what they do.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Sample Wrapper</h1>

<p>A wrapper for LFTP could look like the function below -- this is a variant of what I use in production; I stripped out the logging functions which depend on a broader package. At the core, this is what moves files for me.</p>

<pre><code>#' lftp wrapper to get/put file(s) from ftp-like sites
#'
#' @param process list, pipeable etl objects
#' @param configuration vector (text), list of
#' arguments to supply after call to lftp
#' @param skip boolean, whether to skip this step (testing)
#'
#' @details wrapper around lftp command line tool
#'
#' @export
#'
ftp &lt;- function(configuration, skip = FALSE) {
    if (!skip) {
        system2(""lftp"",
            args = configuration)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The biggest part of the wrapper is the <code>configuration</code> vector. The configuration vector lets you pass an arbitrary set of parameters to <code>lftp</code>, including the ones you'll need to get the job done.</p>

<p>A sample configuration vector could look like:</p>

<pre><code>c(
    'your.ftp-server.com',
    paste(""-e"", '""put '/path/to/file.csv' -o '/destination/'; exit;""'
)
</code></pre>

<p>Noting that you need to be careful about quoting (or you can incorporate <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/shQuote.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shQuote()</a>, but that's a different project).</p>

<h1>Putting It Together</h1>

<p>To answer your specific question, you could use this in R to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the data you're using from Quick Base using <code>rCurl</code></li>
<li>Write it to a file somewhere on your hardware</li>
<li>Use ftp() to leverage <code>lftp</code> to send the file to its destination</li>

<li><strong>domain</strong>: The domain name. Use this field to get fields from only one domain. To return all domains for a customer account, use the <code>customer</code> query parameter instead. Either the <code>customer</code> or the <code>domain</code> parameter <strong>must be provided</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>viewType</strong>: Whether to fetch the administrator-only or domain-wide public view of the user. For more information, see <a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-users#retrieve_users_non_admin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Retrieve a user as a non-administrator</a> (<code>admin_view</code> is default value so we need to override it with <code>domain_view</code>). </li>

<p>Similar answer, but you can just instantiate client side instances of those variables using an un-escaped expression with a value like:</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;script&gt;"" + 
         ""var weekday = '"" + Session.Weekday + ""';"" +
         ""var otherVariable = '"" + Session.OtherVariable + ""';"" +
""&lt;/script&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when you want to update the value of the Session Variable/Site property, just use js/jQuery to set the value of an invisible input box, and then submit it back to the server. If you need to refresh the client side values from the server to the client again, just ajax refresh the un-escaped expression.  Let me know if you want more detail. </p>

body {

  color: var(--text-color); /* will not be used by any browser that doesn't support it, and will default to the previous fallback */
}

<p>This solution is incredibly redundant and 'almost' defeats the purpose of css variables....BUT it is necessary for browser compatibility. Doing this would essentially make the css variables useless but I implore you to still use them because it will serve as an important reminder to the fact that these values are referenced elsewhere and need to be updated in all cases, otherwise you forget to update every related occurrence of 'color' and then you have inconsistent styling because relevant css values are out of sync. The variable will serve more as a comment but a very important one.</p>

<li>First things first we need to figure out concurrency. We need to have chart script on the client before we receive data to render to avoid numerous reperetive checks and inline initializations. In order to do that we need to add visualization library of choice as external JavaScript resource and handle its load.

The model should contain at least to numeric fields (one for x-axis and one for y-axis).</li>
<li>Add container for the chart in can be HTML or Panel widget.</li>
<li>Bind your widget container to the model's datasource</li>

49583950,2,,49550965,2018-03-31T03:31:16.067,,0,,"<p>Thanks for posting u‚Äôr Zoho Creator question here</p>

<p>You have almost got your code , its just , in the criteria : instead of comparing with Employee_ID you have to compare it with input.ID , the actual record ID of the given record.</p>

<p>So u‚Äôr code should look like this.</p>

<pre><code>curpts = Add_Loyalty_Entry[Reward_Member ==  input.ID].sum(Points_Earned);
input.Total_Points = curpts;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explaination</strong></p>

<p>Because it seems you have used the form B lookup in form A and named that lookup as Reward_Member. So if u‚Äôll log a lookup value directly u‚Äôll be getting the record ID of the item you selected in the lookup as you have just shown in u‚Äôr debug info.</p>

<p>so the lookup should be compared with the record ID of the item you want to compare.</p>

<p>So If you want to fetch all the records in form A related to a respective  Reward_Member value, you have to compare the value with the ID of that respective Reward_Member record.</p>

<p>Since you are writing this code on Edit of the Form B ( which seems to be the Reward_Member form ) : to access the ID of that form‚Äôs record you have to use input.ID system field.</p>

<p>( if u‚Äôll be writing this code out of that form u‚Äôll have to fetch the ID first and then compare it in u‚Äôr criteria )</p>

<p>And the <strong>Other Approach</strong> you could use is </p>

<p>Compare the Employee_ID of Reward_Member lookup field with u‚Äôr input.Employee_ID field , and that will balance the criteria and work as well.</p>

<pre><code>curpts = Add_Loyalty_Entry[Reward_Member.Employee_ID == input.Employee_ID].sum(Points_Earned);
input.Total_Points = curpts;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Best Approach</strong></p>

<p>And the best place to put u‚Äôr code would be on submit ( both add and edit ) of the form A , </p>

<p>Cause whenever any Reward_Member will be rewarded with any points , on submit of the record in form A, it will eventually calculate the new total for submitted Reward_Member and update its Total_Points in the Form B , that will make u‚Äôr system consistent instantaneously.</p>

<p>To do that on submit of Form A you should put this code</p>

<pre><code>    if(input.Reward_Member != null)
    {
        total_points_earned = Form_A[Reward_Member == input.Reward_Member].sum(Points_Earned); // calculate updated total points earned
        rm_rec = Form_B[ID==input.Reward_Member]; // fetch reward_member record
        rm_rec.Total_Points = total_points_earned; // update the calculated total points into the fetched reward members record    
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And u‚Äôr good to go.</p>

What gives us <strong>2x2=4</strong> custom styles. We also have multiple ways how to implement styles: override them individually for every widget, customize built-it AM style, implement all-new style from scratch or extend AM built in style using CSS class. I will not cover all these options in this answer this time, but let's start at least with something:</p>

<p>Styles for <strong>individual widget</strong>:</p>



<pre><code>/* Styles for Checkbox widget on the page NewPage with name
   GreenSwitch */

/* Recolor knob's checked state */
.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch-Label::after {
  background-color: green;
}

/* Recolor knob's unckecked state */
.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch&gt;.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch-Input:checked+.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch-Label::after {
  background-color: red;
}

/* Recolor back oval checked state */
.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch-Input {
  background-color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.4);
}

/* Recolor back oval unchecked state */
.app-NewPage-GreenSwitch-Input:checked {
  background-color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Recolor <strong>all checkboxes</strong> with Switch style variant</p>



<pre><code>.app-Checkbox--Switch&gt;.app-Checkbox-Label::after {
  background-color: green;
}

.app-Checkbox--Switch&gt;.app-Checkbox-Input:checked+.app-Checkbox-Label::after {
  background-color: red;
}

.app-Checkbox--Switch&gt;.app-Checkbox-Input {
  background-color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.4);
}

.app-Checkbox--Switch&gt;.app-Checkbox-Input:checked {
  background-color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 0.4);

  <p>how am I supposed to modify this to change the border color?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Properties of controls in PowerApps can have either constant values, or expressions that reference other properties. For example, your control's hover border color is referencing the border color (I'm assuming of the same control), so if you look at the <code>BorderColor</code> property you'll find some expression that defines the color.</p>

<p>For the specific case of colors, the ""constant"" values you can use are either from the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-colors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Color enumeration, or a color name from CSS, or a custom color using the RGBA function</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to set your hover border color to blue, you can use <code>Color.Blue</code> or <code>RGBA(255, 0, 0, 1)</code>.</p>

var res = UrlFetchApp.fetch(apiUrl, options);

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Using Advance Services API we can achieve the same, here's the answer I've received from <strong>Aliaksei Ivaneichyk</strong></p>

<pre><code>function moveFileToFolder(fileId, newFolderId) {  
  var file = Drive.Files.get(fileId, {supportsTeamDrives: true});

  Drive.Files.patch(file, fileId, {
    removeParents: file.parents.map(function(f) { return f.id; }),
    addParents: [newFolderId],
    supportsTeamDrives: true
  });

<p>But your response is an object instead. If you update your custom connector to use a typed object instead, you should be able to access the response from the operation. Something along the lines of the schema below:</p>

<p>Notice that in the portal (web.powerapps.com), if you go to your custom connector definition, and select ""Edit"", you can go to the operation, and select the response you want to edit:</p>

49921560,2,,49914445,2018-04-19T12:49:22.193,,5,,"<p>In AppMaker, there are no columns, only rows. The way you organize the widgets inside the rows is what gives you the column like display. But to answer your question... <strong>YES</strong>, it is possible to allow the user to dynamically hide and show columns in a table widget and it's very very very easy to achieve.</p>

<p>Take into consideration the following example as a demo:</p>

<p>Say you have a datasource with three fields; name, email and assignments. In a new page in app maker, drop a table widget towards the center of the canvas and select that as its datasource. Then add three button widgets on top of the table widget and align them horizontally. Change the text widget of the left button to ""Hide Name"". Then change the text of the middle button to ""Hide Emails"" and then change the text of the right button to ""Hide Assigns"". It should resemble something like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HF7qr.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HF7qr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, click the <strong>left label widget inside the table row</strong> (not inside the table header), and change its name property to ""name"". Do similar with the middle label widget and change its name property to ""email"" and also with the right label widget changing its name property to ""assign"". Take a look at the example below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOMd.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIOMd.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Next, we need to add some logic to the onClick events of our button that will dynamically show and hide the columns. Click on the ""Hide Name"" button and and the following code to the onClick event: </p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>var visibility;
if(widget.text === ""Hide Name""){
  widget.text = ""Show Name"";
  visibility = false;
} else {
  widget.text = ""Hide Name"";
  visibility = true;
}
var table = widget.root.descendants.Table1.descendants;
table.Table1nameHeader.visible = visibility;
var tableRows = table.Table1Body.children._values;
for(var i=0; i&lt;tableRows.length; i++){
  var row = tableRows[i];
  row.children.name.visible = visibility;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to add similar code to the ""Hide Email"" button. Click on that button and add the following code to the onClick event:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>var visibility;
if(widget.text === ""Hide Email""){
  widget.text = ""Show Email"";
  visibility = false;
} else {
  widget.text = ""Hide Email"";
  visibility = true;
}
var table = widget.root.descendants.Table1.descendants;
table.Table1emailHeader.visible = visibility;
var tableRows = table.Table1Body.children._values;
for(var i=0; i&lt;tableRows.length; i++){
  var row = tableRows[i];
  row.children.email.visible = visibility;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, we do the same thing with the ""Hide Assigns"" button. Click on it and add the following code to the onClick event:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>var visibility;
if(widget.text === ""Hide Assigns""){
  widget.text = ""Show Assigns"";
  visibility = false;
} else {
  widget.text = ""Hide Assigns"";
  visibility = true;
}
var table = widget.root.descendants.Table1.descendants;
table.Table1assignmentsHeader.visible = visibility;
var tableRows = table.Table1Body.children._values;
for(var i=0; i&lt;tableRows.length; i++){
  var row = tableRows[i];
  row.children.assign.visible = visibility;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should be all. It's time to preview the app. Please do so and the result should be something like this: </p>

<p>But it seems, that you want to sort related records by their related record. App Maker will not be your friend in this case... but javascript will be! Since App Maker loads <strong><em>all</em></strong> related records you can safely <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sort them on client using javascript</a>:</p>

<p>It will work in O(n * m * log(m)) in case you have n Indicators on the page and every indicator has m associated MetadataTexts. If you want to let users to sort related records by clicking table's header, you'll need to implement that logic on your own. So... all this hassle leads us to alternative solution! What if we decouple related records and introduce separated datasource for them? Having that you'll be able to use full power of App Maker's tables (sorting/paging) with almost no effort.

<p>I ran across this problem and find out that they are forcing admins to set up a default instance in the G Suite Admin console. You can read more about that <strong><a href=""https://support.google.com/a/answer/7550053"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></strong>. You haven't completed that step and that is why you see what you are seeing. Although, it's crazy! What if I don't wanna do that?! But they are the product owners and they establish the rules so we have to suck it up and do what they want! Unless a bunch of people complain about it, they are not changing the behavior. </p>

<p>Fortunately, I was able to find a work around. So what we (you and me) are trying to do, is set up a custom sql database. Right now, that will only be available if you've already done what I described above. So the work around is to import an app that already has a custom sql database set up and then modify the Google Cloud SQL address. Look at the example below:</p>

50368955,2,,42121564,2018-05-16T10:51:24.783,,3,,"<p>I was using this library <a href=""https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/</a> to implement scheduler in App Maker project. But it can be switched to bar timeline widget. Here is an example: <a href=""https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/samples/06_timeline/02_lines.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/samples/06_timeline/02_lines.html</a></p>

<p>To add the widget to your project, open project settings, find <strong>External resources</strong> and add to 
<strong>JavaScript URLs</strong>:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/codebase/ext/dhtmlxscheduler_timeline.js
//cdn.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/edge/dhtmlxscheduler.js</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Also you need to add library styles to <strong>CSS URLs</strong>:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>//cdn.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/edge/dhtmlxscheduler.css</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Now we can init this widget in a project. Add Html widget to your page. For example it has Projects datasource. Check allowUnsafeHtml property and put html code into it:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div id=""schedulerContainer"" tabindex=""0"" aria-label=""events calendar"" class=""dhx_cal_container"" style=""width:960px; height:555px;""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_navline""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_prev_button""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_next_button""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_today_button""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_date""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_tab"" name=""day_tab"" style=""right:204px;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_tab"" name=""week_tab"" style=""right:140px;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_tab"" name=""month_tab"" style=""right:76px;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_header""&gt;Timeline is not loaded&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""dhx_cal_data""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>And add widget initialization to onDataLoad event of the Html widget: </p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>initTimeline(widget);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Now let's create client script and implementation of function <strong>initTimeline</strong>:</p>

<p>This answer is a general guide how to add this widget. But it may contain errors, so I'd advise you to take a look at the <a href=""https://docs.dhtmlx.com/scheduler/how_to_start.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">widget documentation</a> as well </p>

50368956,2,,50084095,2018-05-16T10:51:24.990,,2,,"<p>So first of all to answer your questions, you can't get the source code (C#, ASP.NET, HTML and etc.) that you've made in Outsystems. However the ""code"" that you've made are stored as certain Outsystems file types and can be found in the service center. </p>

<p>.OAP Outsystems application (bundle of modules &amp; extensions)</p>

<p>.OML Outsystems module/eSpace</p>

<p>.XIF Extensions (This is c# or java code what you've made yourself)</p>

<p>.OSP Solution (Bundle of modules/espaces and extensions)</p>

<p>In Outsystems you have two options of deploying, via Lifetime or via the service center. How Lifetime works you can find with this link: <a href=""https://www.outsystems.com/videos/lifetime-application-deployment/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.outsystems.com/videos/lifetime-application-deployment/</a>. Summarized Lifetime provides you a user friendly overview to deploy to another environments and checks if there are broken references between modules/eSpaces.</p>

<p>If you want to deploy via the servicecenter, go to the tab ""Factory"". In the menu below the tabs you will see ""applications"", ""eSpaces"" &amp; etc. If you click on one you can publish applications, modules, etc. </p>

<p>What also important is, when you want to publish a application, module, extension or solution to another Outsystems infrastructure (with a different activation code). You need to use the IPP portal of Outsystems since your code is licensed for your own infrastructure. More information about this you will find here: <a href=""https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Intellectual_Property_Protection_(IPP)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Intellectual_Property_Protection_(IPP)</a>  </p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""false"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>/**

function getAppUrl() {
  return ScriptApp.getService().getUrl();
}</code></pre>

<p>Open your <strong>Project settings</strong> and put next code to <strong>App startup script</strong> section:</p>

<div class=""snippet-code"">

<p>However, you can use client scripts to transform your bindings. For example, if you have a label that bound to <strong>@datasource.item.name</strong>, you can create <strong>Client Script</strong> with a function:</p>

<p>The method I have been calls the stored procedure through Flow. Here's a general idea of how to construct this flow:</p>

<ol>

<li>Select get_customer from the dropdown menu for SQL stored procedures</li>
<li>Test out the flow so you can get sample data. View its results.</li>
<li>In the output of the SQL action, copy the sample data from square bracket [ to square bracket ] to use for generating JSON schema in the next step</li>
<li>Edit the flow again</li>
<li>Search for and insert the 'Request - Response' action</li>
<li>Click 'Use sample payload to generate scheme' and paste the sample data</li>
<li>Configure the body of the Request Response step as: <code>body('Execute_a_SQL_stored_procedure').ResultSets.Table1</code>
The naming in this step may vary depending on your setup.</li>
<li>Name your flow, then same it.</li>
<li><p>In PowerApps, select your button. You can bind it to the flow you just created:</p>

<p>Action > Flows > select your flow</p></li>
<li><p>Collect the results of your flow to a collection.</p></li>
<li>Test out your button. View your Collections to see how it did</li>

<p>If you want to enforce users to enter a message, you need to forbid them to delete records through datasources:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// onBeforeDelete model event
throw new Error('You should provide message prior deleting a record');
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to implement audit itself:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// server script
function archive(itemKey, message) {
  if (!message) {
    throw new Error('Message is required');
  }

  var record = app.models.MyModel.getRecord(itemKey);

  if (!record) {
    throw new Error('Record was not found');
  }

  var archive = app.models.Removed.newRecord();
  archive.Field1 = record.Field1;
  archive.Field2 = record.Field2;
  ...
  archive.Message = message;

  app.saveRecords([archive]);
  app.deleteRecords([record]);

}

// client script
google.script.run
  .withSuccessHandler(function() {
    // TODO
  })
  .withFailureHandler(function() {
    // TODO
  })
  .archive(itemKey, message);
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to implement auditing for multiple/all models then you can generalize the snippet by passing model's name and using <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/api/server#ModelMetadata"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Model Metadata</a>: <code>funciton archive(modelName, itemKey, message) {}</code></p>

<p><strong>Original answer: move to another DB</strong></p>

<p>Normally I would recommend just to add and set a boolean field <code>Deleted</code> to the model and ensure that records marked as deleted are not sent to the client. Implementation of moving data between databases could be tricky since transactions are not supported across <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2239810"">multiple databases</a>.</p>

<p>If you desperately want to make your app more complex and less reliable you can create record's backup in <code>onBeforeDelete</code> <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">model event</a> using <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JDBC Apps Script</a> service (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/jdbc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">External Database Sample</a> could be your friend to start with):</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// onBeforeDelete model event
var connection = Jdbc.getConnection(dbUrl, user, userPassword);

var statement = connection.prepareStatement('INSERT INTO ' + TABLE_NAME +
              ' (Field1, Field2, ...) values (?, ?, ...)');
statement.setString(1, record.Field1);
statement.setString(2, record.Field2);
...
statement.execute();
</code></pre>

<p>Why do you need JDBC? Because App Maker natively doesn't support models attached to different databases.</p>

<p>You said: ""I understand that the standard workflow with a table would be to bind the value of a search box to the @datasources.STUDENTS.query.filters.email._contains""</p>

<p>You need to bind the OPTIONS (not value) to the datasource query, as it is the options that will draw its records from the @datasources.Students.query datasource.</p>

<p>You can then set the VALUE of the multi-select widget to @datasource.item.students (where you want selected values from the student query options to be saved).</p>

<p>You will also need to set the NAMES property (since the options are likely student records). Names will be the Student datasource projection of whatever string field you want to appear in the options list.</p>

<li><code>a - b &gt; 0</code> performs an integer subtraction that can overflow: signed arithmetic overflow is specified as having undefined behavior by the C Standard. It would be simpler and safer to write <code>a &gt; b</code> which is defined for all values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</li>
<li><code>compare(a, b, c)</code> returns <code>c</code> if <code>a</code> is the largest value, <code>a</code> if <code>b</code> is the largest and <code>b</code> if <code>c</code> is the largest... The result is therefore heavily dependent on the order of the parameters given. One may wonder if the intend was to compute the max value of a triplet instead, which would not depend on the order of the parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder what is really expected from the candidate facing this test.</p>

<h2>Issues and workarounds for this situation :</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>When such large CSV file is converted to Spreadsheet, it cannot directly convert to Spreadsheet, because of both the total number of cells and the size of file. And also when the large file is tried to split, it cannot do it because the blob which can be used at GAS is less than 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes).</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to split such large file, it uses <a href=""https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads#partial_download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Partial download""</a> of files.get in Drive API.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In my environment, when a CSV file with the size of 100 MB is used for this sample script, when the file is split by 10 MB, about 65 seconds was required to convert a chunk to Spreadsheet.

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage :</h2>

<p>When you use this, please modify <code>obj</code> in <code>main()</code> for your situation, and run <code>main()</code>. A sample case is as follows.</p>

<p>It supposes as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to convert the CSV file with the size of 100 MB to 10 spreadsheets.</li>
<li>Size of one chunk is 10 MB.</li>
<li>CSV file is processed by every 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sample case, each <code>obj</code> is as follows. Please input each <code>obj</code> at each run.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: 0, fileName: ""sample"", number: 1}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart2 ###, ""nextNumber"": 4}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart2 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 4}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart3 ###, ""nextNumber"": 7}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart3 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 7}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart4 ###, ""nextNumber"": 10}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart4 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 10}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>null</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>By this flow, 10 spreadsheets are created from the CSV file with the size of 100 MB.</p>

<p>If <code>null</code> is used for <code>files</code> in <code>obj</code>, <code>files</code> is automatically calculated. But in this case, the limitation time for executing GAS may be over. Please be careful this.</p>

Most likely the Model Security setup should help you accomplish what you want to do, however to set this up you need to use the 'Advanced' option under model security. For your Contracts model set the 'Load' option to 'Owner or Roles', the field option you would need to choose is 'Advanced' and that will give you the option to set your field email to related models email field option. For this to work your Manager model needs to have a 'Manager Email' field.</p>

<p>Assumptions made:</p>

<ol>
<li>3 models, Managers, Employees, and Contracts.</li>
<li>Managers model has an email field and Employees model has an email field.</li>

<p>You can do the same when navigating from the second to the third screen:</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(ThirdScreen, Fade, { Variable: Variable })

<p>Notice that the name of the context variable in the second screen is <code>Variable</code> (as it was defined in the <code>Navigate</code> function, so you would use that name as the value of the variable to pass to the third screen.</p>

<p>Another option is to define the selection as a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">global variable</a>, which can be accessed via multiple screens.

<p>That makes <code>Variable</code> a global variable that can be accessed in any screen of the app, including the third one for more details.</p>

<p>Yet another option is not to use variables, but instead rely on the <code>Selected</code> property of the gallery to access the properties of the selected item. For example, in the second screen where you currently have <code>Variable.PropertyName</code>, you would use <code>GalleryName.Selected.PropertyName</code>. You can access controls from any screen in the app, so this expression would also work in the third screen.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm now using the all models to import relation too.</p>

<p>Her are some comments. if you have any information to give me, don‚Äôt hesitate to tell me</p>

<p>My goal is to export all the models from a test environment in a spreadsheet, add row manually or modify, then later on I will import all the data on a prod environment</p>

<p>1)  I‚Äôve exported all the data OK
2)  I‚Äôve re imported all the data : </p>

<p>First remark :  if one of the spread sheet tab is empty (only one line with the title column)
 I‚Äôve got an error at import : Cannot read property ""length"" from null. 0 records imported
I‚Äôve deleted all the tabs that don‚Äôt have data, and now not any more this error</p>

<p>Second remark: I‚Äôve another import message from google import
Value error at cell ""V:6"": Can't import association: ""Invit - Event"", because record key is not defined. 0 records imported
Event is my father model and Invit is my son model. (for One Event I‚Äôve many Invitation)
About V:6 , in Invit tab V is the relation column to the Event. (it contains all the key that are link with the main _Key of the Event model, the name of this column is the name of the relation I‚Äôve created)
The first 5 lines of this tab are the invitation I‚Äôve made manually using the my appmaker application, (and each of these line have a _Key value on column A) the line 6 and after are invitation I‚Äôve added manually (coming from another tool, theses are old invitations I need to import)
On line 6 and after the column A (_key) is empty
The cell value in V:6 is an Event(_Key) ant it exist. So I don‚Äôt understand the import error message from Google. (do you understand this message?)</p>

<p>Third remarks
I‚Äôve jus done this test:
Create a new son relation using the appmaker tool
Export all the data
Re -import exactly the same data
And I‚Äôve got this error
Drive Table internal error. Record not found. 0 associations imported</p>

<p>Do you know where I can find information about importing relation, on this page <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/import-export"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/import-export</a>  nothing about relation</p>

Every time you load a calculated model the script you write under that model's datasource is ran. That script usually loads data from an external source (I.e. grabbing stock prices from an API, loading data from an external SQL server, or generating random placeholder data).</p>

<p>You could use the cloud SQL models for this application that you are building - your table with all department names that is supposed to be displayed in the second page could just be a cloud SQL table with one single field for a department name.</p>

<p>I suggest you work through the example apps so you can get a better understanding of how the different components work.  <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/tutorials/work-with-data/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a link to one for you to get started.</a></p>

<p>In short, you're going to create a few models to store information (I suggest using cloud SQL as the calculated models will require code whereas cloud SQL is more plug and play through app maker's bindings).  Before you create any pages try to lay out how your databases will look as that will dictate how you set bindings or program your scripts. </p>

<p>Asking to completely make what is essentially a combination of the tutorials already provided by Google is pretty counter intuitive - you should ask more specific questions in regards to implementation.  </p>

<p>As for App Maker being a low-code environment, that's only partially true.  For very, very simple apps (think glorified forms) you will need only a couple lines of code and can probably do everything through drag-and-drop.  However, anything more complicated than a simple form will almost certainly require a good chunk of actual code.  There are plenty of resources online to learn Javascript.</p>

51353469,2,,51351353,2018-07-16T01:15:30.523,,4,,"<p>Depending on what you actually need to achieve the following may help.</p>

<p><code>autoEnablesDefaultLighting</code> is a Boolean value that determines whether SceneKit automatically adds lights to a scene or not.</p>

<p>By default this is set as <code>false</code> meaning that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the only light sources SceneKit uses for rendering a scene are those
  contained in the scene graph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If on the other hand, this is set to <code>true</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SceneKit automatically adds and places an omnidirectional light source
  when rendering scenes that contain no lights or only contain ambient
  lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is located from the position of the camera and pointing in the direction of the camera. </p>

<p>One issue that <a href=""https://blog.markdaws.net/arkit-by-example-part-4-realism-lighting-pbr-b9a0bedb013e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mark Daws</a> noted in his excellent article is that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The light has a changing direction, so as you walk around an object it
  will always look like the light is coming from your point of view
  (like you are holding a torch infront of you) which isn‚Äôt the case
  normally, most scenes have static lighting so your model will look
  unnatural as you move around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>isLightEstimationEnabled</code> on the other hand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>provides light estimates in the lightEstimate property of each ARFrame
  it delivers.
  If you render your own overlay graphics for the AR scene, you can use
  this information in shading algorithms to help make those graphics
  match the real-world lighting conditions of the scene captured by the
  camera. The ARSCNView class automatically uses this information to
  configure SceneKit lighting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means, is that if you dim the lights in your room for example, and want to apply these lighting conditions on your virtual objects to make them more realistic, this is what you want to use; since with this information we can take the lightEstimate from every frame and modify the intensity of the lights in our scene to mimic the ambient light intensity of the real world itself.</p>

<p>You can get details of lightingEstimate by setting:</p>

<p><code>configuration.isLightEstimationEnabled = true</code> </p>

<p>And then using the following callback:</p>

<pre><code>//--------------------------
// MARK: - ARSCNViewDelegate
//--------------------------

extension ViewController: ARSCNViewDelegate{

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {

        guard let lightEstimate = self.augmentedRealityView.session.currentFrame?.lightEstimate else { return }

        let ambientLightEstimate = lightEstimate.ambientIntensity

        let ambientColourTemperature = lightEstimate.ambientColorTemperature


        print(
            """"""
            Current Light Estimate = \(ambientLightEstimate)
            Current Ambient Light Colour Temperature Estimate = \(ambientColourTemperature)
            """""")


        if ambientLightEstimate &lt; 100 { print(""Lighting Is Too Dark"") }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then need to do something with the values returned and apply them to your sceneLights.</p>

<p>Putting it into practice therefore a very basic example might look like so:</p>

<pre><code>//--------------------------
// MARK: - ARSCNViewDelegate
//--------------------------

extension ViewController: ARSCNViewDelegate{

    func renderer(_ renderer: SCNSceneRenderer, updateAtTime time: TimeInterval) {

        //2. Get The Ambient Intensity &amp; Colour Temperatures

        let ambientColourTemperature = lightEstimate.ambientColorTemperature

        print(
            """"""
            Current Light Estimate = \(ambientLightEstimate)
            Current Ambient Light Colour Temperature Estimate = \(ambientColourTemperature)
            """""")

        if ambientLightEstimate &lt; 100 { print(""Lighting Is Too Dark"") }

        //3. Adjust The Scene Lighting
        sceneLight.intensity = ambientLightEstimate
        sceneLight.temperature = ambientColourTemperature

<p>In summary, appmaker is not able to create the field with the same name and different data type because the field name already exists in the sql backend. The only thing you can do is to completely delete that field and get rid of the data, or restore the field and continue using strings. I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Here are the steps that template will do for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>End user will see all the request he has already made on the home screen. If any. On the right hand side '+' button, user can start a new request.</li>
<li>Here an end user can choose any document from Google Drive/ Team Drive and provide the description for that file and click on 'ADD' button. On the next screen he can provide a list of approvers. Here this template supports both sequential and parallel approvals. i.e. More than one approver can take action at same time or you can have a workflow like approvals where Approver 1 approves first then only Approver 2 gets notified for the action.</li>
<li>Once all approvers are in place users can submit the request and Doc is sent for Approvals with the approvers.</li>
<li>Approvers can Approve/Reject the request with Comments. After all approvals are done workflow is closed.</li>

<p><strong>EDIT 02/17/2020</strong></p>

<p>There has been a change in the Drive picker API. To make this work please change what you have to:</p>

<pre><code>var folderId = ""10fYS3l32R6gk79POOSS8X_Vbsz7vqzRWX""; //the desired folder id
pickerBuilder.mw.$e[""0""].Ra.parent = folderId;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>To answer your questions directly:</p>

<p>1.) YES <br>
2.) YES</p>

<p>Now, let's dig a little bit into what's happening under the hood. You are right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My guess is that appmaker contstructs the first upload tab behind the curtains and there is no feature to disable this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, we can manipulate the object. So instead of creating a new picker view, let's simply configure the default one to upload the files to the folder you want. We can achieve that by doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) After you insert a Drive Picker into your UI, make sure the <strong>Drive Picker Properties</strong> are all empty:<br><br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LO0lG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LO0lG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>2.) Next, go to the event handlers and click on the <strong>onPickerInit</strong> event handler. Type in this code:</p>

<pre><code>var folderId = ""10fYS3l32R6gk79POOSS8X_Vbsz7vqzRWX""; //the desired folder id
pickerBuilder.SW.Vq[""0""].mc.parent = folderId; 
</code></pre>

<p>In summary, I've come to the conclusion that the property <strong>SW</strong> contains the array of drive views, which are saved under the property <strong>Vq</strong>. <strong>Vq[""0""]</strong> is the first view in the array of views and the <strong>mc</strong> property contains the features; hence <strong>parent = folderId</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>UpdateContext({ mailVisible: false })

<p>And set the <code>Visible</code> property of the <code>Mail</code> control to <code>mailVisible</code>. You may need to initialize that variable to <code>true</code>, for example, in the screen's <code>OnVisible</code> property:</p>

<p>PowerApps works similarly to Excel - you cannot, by an action, change directly the value of a cell (e.g., <code>A1 = 42</code>). But you can make the A1 cell reference another cell (say, <code>=A4</code>), so when you change the value of the cell <code>A4</code>, A1 will be updated as well. The same principle applies in PowerApps - you cannot change the value of a property from an action, but you can update the value that the property references.</p>

<p>The problem is due to an incorrect configuration of Route 53.</p>

<p>Here are the explanations.</p>

<p>The first step that Route 53 needs to do is registering your new domain by contacting the io TLD registry. There are only two registrar IDs used by Route 53: 468 and 81, depending on the TLD (see IANA Registrar IDs public list: 81 is the registrar of a subcontractor of Amazon, and 468 is directly registered to Amazon). Therefore, we can check that your domain has been correctly registered, or not, to the io TLD <strong>registry</strong> by one of the two <strong>registrars</strong> used by AWS:</p>

<pre><code>% whois -h whois.nic.io trogg.io | grep 'Registrar IANA ID'
Registrar IANA ID: 81
</code></pre>

<p>Since the registrar ID found in the output of the whois request is 81, we can conclude that Amazon has certainly done correctly the first step.</p>

<p>The 2nd step that Route 53 needs to do is sending the names of some AWS DNS servers to the registry, to add NS resource records that delegate that domain from the io domain servers to the AWS servers.</p>

<p>We can check this 2nd step with two different tools: <code>whois</code> and <code>dig</code>.</p>

<p>First, we use whois to look for the DNS records in the database of the io TLD registry:</p>

<pre><code>% whois -h whois.nic.io trogg.io | grep 'Name Server'
Name Server: NS-673.AWSDNS-20.NET
Name Server: NS-1685.AWSDNS-18.CO.UK
Name Server: NS-304.AWSDNS-38.COM
Name Server: NS-1263.AWSDNS-29.ORG
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, we query some io name server for NS records for your domain:</p>

<pre><code>% dig io ns +short | head -1
ns-a3.io.
% dig @ns-a3.io. trogg.io NS | grep trogg.io
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @ns-a3.io. trogg.io NS
;trogg.io.          IN  NS
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-304.awsdns-38.com.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-673.awsdns-20.net.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-1263.awsdns-29.org.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-1685.awsdns-18.co.uk.
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the whois database and the io zone contain the same DNS list of four AWS name servers.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, we can conclude that the io registry has done its jobs correctly.</strong></p>

<p>The following step for Route 53 is to host your domain name on these four name servers, with at least one SOA resource record.</p>

<p>So we check for this task:</p>

<pre><code>% for ns in ns-304.awsdns-38.com. ns-673.awsdns-20.net. ns-1263.awsdns-29.org. ns-1685.awsdns-18.co.uk.
for&gt; do
for&gt; dig @$ns trogg.io soa | grep ANSWER
for&gt; done
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the ANSWER count is 0 for each of the four servers.</p>

<p>Therefore, your domain is not hosted by Route 53 servers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What am I missing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is not due to the io TLD servers nor to the Zoho Mail service.
It is only due to your DNS not being correctly configured on Route 53.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it because the domain is .io?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, AWS can register any io domain by means of one of its subcontractors, that is named GANDI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe I need some other product/service configured in addition to Route 53?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is only due to your configuration of Route 53. Your problem with Zoho Mail is not due to Zoho Mail.</p>

The app only contains a ""dataset name"" which is a key that the connector can use to find the actual file (workbook), and there's no way to retrieve which file that key maps to. You can consider creating a new feature request in the <a href=""https://aka.ms/powerapps-ideas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerApps Ideas board</a> for this.</p>

<p>One possible way to find out which file contains a given table is to make a change to that table (i.e., using the app, first add a new record, then remove it) - and go over the workbooks that you have stored in OneDrive to see which one was updated more recently. Granted, this may take some time if you have multiple folders where the workbook can be stored, but that was the only way I could find today.</p>

<p>First you need to set relations to your models so you can query by filters and ""assign"" issues to Techs per its type and location. Your model relations would look like this:</p>

<p>One <strong>Issue</strong> to One <strong>Location</strong> <br>
Many <strong>Issues</strong> to One <strong>Tech</strong></p>

<p>You then create Issues and associate Locations and Techs with the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/data-widgets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Forms</a> widget.
If you want to automatically assign an issue to a Tech per a criteria, you'll have to replace the default ""Create New Item"" onClick function on the Forms Button with another function. You can change associations with a client script or server script. See documentation <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/relations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Try this client script I made:</p>

<pre><code>function createAssignIssuePublic(){

  // Datasources declaration
  var issuesDatasource = app.datasources.Issues;
  var locationDatasource = app.datasources.Locations;

  // Creates an Issue item(record) and after it's finished a Tech is associated to it.
  // Notice the callback function.
  issuesDatasource.createItem(function(record){

    var techsDatasource = app.datasources.Techs;

    // Create a query.
    var techsQuery = techsDatasource.query;

    var issue = issuesDatasource.item;
    var location = issue.Location.Name;

    // Setting the conditionals to assign Tech per issue and location
    if (issue.Type == ""Computer issue""){

      // Query by filter (name equals)
      techsQuery.filters.Name._equals = ""Computer Tech"";

      // Reloads Tech datasource per previous query filter. 
      // Once loaded, it relates the tech item to the issue item/record.
      techsDatasource.load(function(){
        var relatedTech = techsDatasource.item;

        // Changes the Associated Tech
        record.Tech = relatedTech;
      });
  }

  // If issue is ""Wiring issue"" but NOT in a ""Critical Location""
  else if (issue.Type == ""Wiring issue"" &amp;&amp; location !== ""Critical Location""){

      techsQuery.filters.Name._equals = ""Wiring Tech"";

      techsDatasource.load(function(){
        var relatedTech = techsDatasource.item;                  
        record.Tech = relatedTech;
      });
  }

  // If issue is ""Wiring issue"" but IN in a ""Critical Location""
  else if (issue.Type == ""Wiring issue"" &amp;&amp; location == ""Critical Location""){

      techsQuery.filters.Name._equals = ""Tech Lead"";

      techsDatasource.load(function(){
        var relatedTech = techsDatasource.item;
        record.Tech = relatedTech;            
      });
  }

  else{} });}
</code></pre>

<p><br> What makes the last table to show issues by the Tech selected, is that the Dropdown widget has a value of <code>@datasources.Issues.query.filters.Tech._equals</code> and it reloads the Issues Datasource onValueChange.</p>

<p>For the textbox or textarea widget set the following onInputChange event script:</p>

<pre><code>var elem = widget.value;

if (elem !== null) {
  var length = elem.length;
  widget.parent.children.Label6.text = (widget.maxLength - length).toString();
} else {
  widget.parent.children.Label6.text = widget.maxLength.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>That would get the same thing accomplished.</p>

<p>Alternatively follow steps 1-4 and then create the following function in your client script:</p>

<pre><code>function caracteres(widget1, widget2) {
  var cadena = widget1.value;

  if (cadena !== null) {
    var x = cadena.length;
    console.log(x);
    widget2.text = (widget1.maxLength - x).toString();
  } else {
    widget2.text = widget1.maxLength.toString();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in your textbox or textarea widget onDataLoad and onInputChange events include the following:</p>

<pre><code>caracteres(widget, widget.parent.children.Label6);
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can reuse the same function for multiple textboxes or textareas throughout your application.</p>

<p>You would first need to retrieve the relevant metadata with a metadata api retrieve call using your tool of choice. Here's a sample package manifest for performing a retrieval of the lightning definitions and related resources:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ cat package.xml 
&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;Package xmlns=""http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata""&gt;
    &lt;types&gt;
        &lt;members&gt;*&lt;/members&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;AuraDefinitionBundle&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/types&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;43.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/Package&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then find the files that contain the text string indicating the component in question, in this case, <code>c:myCmp</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ grep c:myCmp -R .
./aura/myApp/myApp.app:    &lt;c:myCmp /&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that I haven't commented that section out, this would show that <code>myCmp</code> is being used in <code>myApp</code>. </p>

<p>I would imagine most of the IDE's out there would provide a similar type of search function. </p>

<hr>

<p>Another option, if you know for sure the component is being referenced, would be to attempt to delete the component and look at the resulting errors. </p>

<p>For example, a deployment with a <code>destructiveChanges.xml</code> file that attempted to delete the <code>myCmp</code> lightning component failed because the component was being referenced by <code>myApp</code>: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWtoA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWtoA.png"" alt=""Deployment error""></a></p>

<p>And you don't need to use the metadata api for this trick either, an attempt to delete a referenced component in the developer console will also show the error: </p>

51833646,2,,51820368,2018-08-14T04:18:53.697,,1,,"<p>I believe you are getting confused with some terminology in PowerApps. An app in that platform consists of many <em>screens</em>, and you can <em>Navigate</em> from one screen to another. Each screen can have controls that displays data from (possibly) one or more tables. If you want to ""navigate from one table to another"", you need to create a couple of screens, one containing one of the tables, and another containing the other table, and navigate between them.</p>

<p>Another issue that I could find is your expression for the <code>OnSelect</code> property of the arrow:</p>

<pre><code>Filter(Table3,Code in Table2.Club);Navigate(DetailScreen2, ScreenTransition.Fade)
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of that expression is not doing anything - a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Filter</code></a> function doesn't change any of its parameters; instead it <em>returns</em> a new table (not stored anywhere, just something that can be used as an input for another expression or a control).</p>

<p>If I understand correctly your scenario, you have two tables, and you want the user to select (in the browse screen) items from the first table (<code>table3</code>), and on the second (browse screen) you want to edit a single item from the second table (<code>table2</code>) - using the code from the first selection to find the item you want to display on the second table.</p>

<p>If this is the case, there are a few ways you can go about it. You can have in the <code>OnSelect</code> property of the arrow (in the gallery displaying data from <code>table3</code>) the following expression:</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(DetailScreen2, ScreenTransition.Fade, { selectedCode: ThisItem.Code })
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-navigate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Navigate</code> function</a> can take an optional third parameter, a <em>context</em> that will be passed to the next screen. This way, in the screen <code>DetailScreen2</code> you can reference the context variable <code>code</code>, and configure the display form with the following properties:</p>

<pre><code>DataSource: table2
Item: LookUp(table2, Code = selectedCode)
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Lookup</code> function</a> will return an item from the second table, which then can be displayed in the form for that screen.</p>

51941735,2,,51847975,2018-08-21T04:49:25.737,,0,,"<p>Overall, there's no easy way to find out the structure of a data source in PowerApps (please create a new feature request in the <a href=""https://aka.ms/powerapps-ideas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerApps Ideas board</a> for that). There is a convoluted way to find it out, however, which I'll go over here.</p>

<p>But for your specific problem, this is the schema of a SQL table that would match the schema of the data source in PowerApps:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE PowerAppsTest.StackOverflow51847975 (
    PrimaryID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    [Id] NVARCHAR(MAX),
    [Message] NVARCHAR(MAX),
    CreatedOnDateTime NVARCHAR(MAX),
    CreatorEmail NVARCHAR(MAX),
    CreatorName NVARCHAR(MAX),
    RecipientEmail NVARCHAR(MAX),
    RecipientName NVARCHAR(MAX),
    ShoutoutType NVARCHAR(MAX),
    [Image] IMAGE
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the generic case. You've been warned that this is convoluted, so proceed at your own risk :)</p>

<p>First, save the app locally to your computer:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMj5e.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMj5e.png"" alt=""Save to local computer""></a></p>

<p>The app will be saved with the .msapp extension, but it's basically a .zip file. If you're using Windows, you can rename it to change the extension to .zip and you'll be able to uncompress and extract the files that describe the app.</p>

<p>One of those files, Entities.json, contains, among other things, the definition of the schema of all data sources used in the app. The file is a huge JSON file, and it has all of its whitespaces removed, so you may want to use some online tool to format (or prettify) the JSON to read it easier. Once this is done, you can open the file in your favorite text editor (anything better than Notepad should be able to handle it).</p>

<p>With the file opened, search for an entry in the JSON root with the property ""Name"" and the value equal to the name of the data source. For example, in the shoutouts app case, the data source is called ""Shoutout"", so search for</p>

<pre><code>""Name"": ""Shoutout""
</code></pre>

<p>You'll have to remove the space if you didn't pretty-print the JSON file prior to opening it. This should be an object that describes the data source, and it has one property called <code>DataEntityMetadataJson</code> that has the data source schema, formatted as a JSON string. Again in the Shoutouts example, this is the value:</p>

<pre><code>""{\""name\"":\""Shoutout\"",\""title\"":\""Shoutout\"",\""x-ms-permission\"":\""read-write\"",\""schema\"":{\""type\"":\""array\"",\""items\"":{...
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that it again is not pretty-printed. You'll first need to decode that string, then pretty-print it again, and you'll end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""name"": ""Shoutout"",
  ""title"": ""Shoutout"",
  ""x-ms-permission"": ""read-write"",
  ""schema"": {
    ""type"": ""array"",
    ""items"": {
      ""type"": ""object"",
      ""properties"": {
        ""PrimaryID"": {
          ""type"": ""number"",
          ""format"": ""double"",
          ...
        },
        ""Message"": {
          ""type"": ""string"",
          ...
        },
        ""Image"": {
          ""type"": ""string"",
          ""format"": ""uri"",
          ""x-ms-media-kind"": ""image"",
          ...
        },
        ""Id"": {
          ""type"": ""string"",
          ...
        },
        ""CreatedOnDateTime"": {
          ""type"": ""string"",
          ...
        },
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the schema for the data source. From that I recreated the schema in SQL, removed the reference to the Shoutout data source from the app (which caused many errors), then added a reference to my SQL table, and since it has a different name, went looking for all places that have errors in the app to fix those.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Admin Directory push notifications require a web-hook URL endpoint to receive notifications. You might think deploying a GAS web app and using its URL as an endpoint would be sufficient. But the thing with Admin Directory Push notifications is that its data payload resides in custom HTTP headers which cannot be accessed from a GAS Web App. (This also holds true for push notifications across other APIs including the Drive and Calendar APIs)</p>

<p>You can however leverage Google Cloud Functions (a GCP service) in tandem with GAS, but you'll have to know your way around Node.js.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>After giving this some thought, and reviewing your requirements I believe there is a way to pull this off just using GAS.</p>

<p>You can setup a unique push notification channel for a given event per user/domain (the 'update' event in your use case) by <a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/push#making-watch-requests"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">setting the event parameter when initializing the watch</a>. Thus the GAS web app will only be triggered if an update event occurs; you don't really need to rely on the HTTP header to determine the event type. </p>

<p>If you want to track multiple events, you simply create a unique channel per event and use the same GAS Web app endpoint for each one. You differentiate between events by checking the event parameter sent in the POST request. This should remove the need for middle-man services such as Heroku or Google Cloud Functions.  </p>

51968285,2,,51966939,2018-08-22T13:43:16.140,,1,,"<p>I was able to set up push notifications for a local resource (a spreadsheet) using Heroku-based Node.js app as an intermediary API. The Node app captures the custom request headers and builds the payload to be consumed by the doPost(e) function of the GAS web app. </p>

<p>The code for constructing a watch request is simple</p>

<pre><code>  //get the unique id
  var channelId = Utilities.getUuid();  
  //build the resource object    
  var resource = {  
    ""id"": channelId,
    ""type"": ""web_hook"",
    ""address"": ""https://yourapp.herokuapp.com/drivesub    
  }

//watch the resource
Drive.Files.watch(resource, fileId);
</code></pre>

<p>The challenge is to get that domain address verified. There are ways to verify the standalone (not file-bound!) GAS web app, however, as previous posters have mentioned, the Apps Script web app can't access custom headers.</p>

<p>After you've enabled the Pub/Sub API and created the topic &amp; subscription, go to APIs &amp; Services -> Credentials -> Domain verification. It gives you a few options of verifying your domain, including serving the html file. Download the file generated by Google. Thankfully, Heroku makes it very easy to deploy a Node app</p>

<p><a href=""https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs</a></p>

<p>After your domain is verified you can make your subscription push data to the endpoint URL on Heroku.</p>

<p>I simply created the js file for route handlers and created one specifically for domain verification</p>

<pre><code>handlers.verifyDomain = function(callback){
    //Synchronously read from the static html file. Async method fs.readFile() doesn't make the file available to the router callback
    var file = fs.readFileSync('./google/google_file.html');
    callback(200, file); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then include the handler in your router object like so:</p>

<pre><code>var router = {
    ""google_file.html"": handlers.verifyDomain
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in your server starting function, get the path from the URL (there are multiple ways of doing that), and execute the handler;</p>

<pre><code>    var routeHandler = router(path);
    routerHandler(function(statusCode, file){ 
      //do something 
     });
</code></pre>

<p>Go back to domain verification tool and load the HTML page to verify the URL. After it's verified, the only remaining step is creating the GAS web app and posting to it.</p>

<p>Back to Node app. Note that my endpoint is <a href=""https://yourapp.herokuapp.com/drivesub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://yourapp.herokuapp.com/drivesub</a></p>

<pre><code>//The code for posting data to GAS web app. Of course, you need to
// update your router with router['driveSub'] = handlers.driveSub

handlers.driveSub = function(data, callback){
    var headers = data.headers;
    var options = {
        method:""POST"",
        uri: your_gas_app_url, 
        json:{""headers"":headers}
    };
    //Use NPM to install the request module
    request.post(options, function(err, httpResponse, body){
        console.log(err, body);

    });
    callback(200, data);

    }

<p>Google supports push notifications across many of their APIs. However there are many subtle (and not so subtle) differences between them. Some that leverage webhooks send their data payloads primarily as HTTP headers; for example Drive API and Calendar API. Others mix their payloads across HTTP headers and a POST body(ex: AdminDirectory API). And its gets even crazier, with some APIs utilizing different mechanisms altogether (ex: GMail API leverages Cloud PubSub).</p>

<p>There are nuances to each but your goal is to leverage AdminDirectory push notifications in a GAS app. To do that you need a GAS Web App whose URL can serve as a web-hook endpoint.</p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 1 - Deploy A Stand-Alone Script As A Web App</h2>

<p>Let's start with the following template script and deploy it as a Web App from the Apps Script Editor menu <strong><code>Publish &gt; Deploy As Web App</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>/** HTTP GET request handler */
function doGet(e) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""GET message"");
}

/** HTTP POST request handler */
function doPost(e) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""POST message"");
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 2 - Verify/Validate Domain Ownership And Add/Register Domain</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>As of August 2019, GAS Web App URLs can no longer be verified using this method. Google Cloud Functions may be a viable</em>
  <em>alternative</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the web app deployed you now have to verify and register the domain of the receiving url, which in this case is also the web app url. This url takes the following form:</p>

<p><code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/exec</code></p>

<p>Technically you cannot own a GAS web app url's domain. Thankfully the App Script Gods at Google do provide a mechanism to verify and register a GAS web app url.</p>

<p>From the Apps Script Editor menu select <strong><code>Publish &gt; Register in Chrome Web Store</code></strong>. Registering a published web app with the Chrome Web Store also validates the URL's domain (no need to fiddle with the search console). </p>

<p>Once validated you need to <a href=""https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/domainverification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">add the ""domain"" via the Domain verification page in the API Console</a>. The ""domain"" is everything in the url sans the 'exec', so you'll add a string that looks like this:</p>

<p><code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/</code></p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 3 - Make a watch request</h2>

<p>For this step the AdminSDK/Directory API service should be enabled both for your App Script project and in the API Console. </p>

<p>Create a function that generates a watch request (this can be retooled for other event types):</p>

<pre><code>function startUpdateWatch() {
    var channel = AdminDirectory.newChannel(),
        receivingURL = ""https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/exec"",
        gSuiteDomain = ""[business-name].com"",
        event = ""update"";

    channel.id = Utilities.getUuid();
    channel.type = ""web_hook"";
    channel.address = receivingURL + ""?domain="" + gSuiteDomain + ""&amp;event="" + event;
    channel.expiration = Date.now() + 21600000; // max of 6 hours in the future; Note: watch must be renew before expiration to keep sending notifications

    AdminDirectory.Users.watch(
        channel, 
        {
            ""domain"":gSuiteDomain,
            ""event"":event
        }
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that Directory API push notifications have an expiration, the max being 6 hours from starting the watch so it must be renewed periodically to ensure notifications are sent to the endpoint URL. Typically you can use a time-based trigger to call this function every 5 hours or so.</p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 4 - Update doPost(e) trigger to handle incoming notifications</h2>

<p>Unlike the push mechanisms of other APIs, the Directory API sends a POST body along with its notifications, so the doPost(e) method is guaranteed to be triggered when a notification is sent. Tailor the doPost(e) trigger to handle incoming events and re-deploy the web app:</p>

<pre><code>function doPost(e) {

    switch(e.parameter.event) {
        case ""update"":
            // do update stuff
            break;

        case ""add"":
            break;

        case ""delete"":
            break;
    }

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""POST message"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>There is one caveat to keep in mind. Push notifications for update events only tell you that the user's data was updated, it won't tell you exactly what was changed. But that's a problem for another question.</p>

<p>Note that there are a ton of details I left out but this should be enough to get you up and running.</p>

<p>Bruce Mcpherson explains this on <a href=""http://ramblings.mcpher.com/Home/excelquirks/gassnips/promisesandappsscript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Using promises with Google Apps Script</a>.</p>

<p>The client side code:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @namespace Provoke
 * promise management for async calls
 */

var Provoke =(function (ns) {

  /**
  * run something asynchronously
  * @param {string} namespace the namespace (null for global)
  * @param {string} method the method or function to call
  * @param {...} the args
  * @return {Promise} a promise
  */
  ns.run = function (namespace,method) {

    // the args to the server function
    var runArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).slice(2);
    console.log(runArgs);
    if (arguments.length&lt;2) {
      throw new Error ('need at least a namespace and method');
    }

    // this will return a promise
    return new Promise(function ( resolve , reject ) {

      google.script.run

      .withFailureHandler (function(err) {
        reject (err);
      })

      .withSuccessHandler (function(result) {
        resolve (result);
      })

      .exposeRun (namespace,method,runArgs); 
    });


  };


  return ns;

})(Provoke || {});
</code></pre>

<p>The server side code:</p>

<pre><code>/**
* used to expose memebers of a namespace
* @param {string} namespace name
* @param {method} method name
*/
function exposeRun (namespace, method , argArray ) {
  var func = (namespace ? this[namespace][method] : this[method])
  if (argArray &amp;&amp; argArray.length) {
    return func.apply(this,argArray);
  }
  else {
    return func();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The way to use the above on the client side is</p>

<pre><code>Provoke.run ( 'Server', 'getData_' , 100)
.then (function (result) {
   '//do something with the result
},
function (err) {

<ul>
<li>The association of relations seems to be all or none. If you have a problem with one relation, none of them will process at all.</li>
<li>When it says ""All Models and Relations data"", it really mean <strong>ALL</strong> models. Even if you have models without any relations to worry about, or even without any active data in them yet, each one has to have a tab in your Sheet or the association of relations will fail.</li>
<li>Relations are <strong>required</strong>. In other words, if you have a situation like mine where you have a supervisor relation for an employee, you can't just leave the supervisor field for the CEO blank. A key for a valid relation item has to be present for every related field in every datasource, or the association of relations will fail.</li>

.red {

<p>In my example I set up a grid widget and for the widget onDataLoad event I reference the grid widget children and then iterate over all children, calling the first descendant of each cell and then logging the text.
This should probably get you in the right direction anyway. Depending on what you are trying to do with each descendant in a grid cell however, you may want to decide on binding each descendant instead or basing what you are trying to accomplish on the datasource item. Also, consider that descendants of a cell may be many elements, so you may need to iterate over each descendant as well.</p>

<p>OutSystems uses a hidden .Tenant_Id attribute on each entity to indicate which tenant that user belongs to. You can unhide this attribute for the users entity by selecting it, clicking More... and then ticking the relevant box in the Advanced tab. You can then access the attribute directly, but be aware this will hinder OutSystems' ability to do some of the stuff it does automatically to ensure that you access tenant specific data.</p>

<p>When you use the User_Login action OutSystems will deduce which tenant to use from the User.Tenant_Id attribute regardless of which tenant you've switched it to previously. The user would need an account for each tenant they need to use, but there's no reason this couldn't be done behind the scenes with OS fetching the correct username before logging in. You'd need to ensure they all stay in sync though, especially the passwords ofc.</p>

The key is to use the HTML widget in Google App Maker. Then you parse the string can convert it to html and load it into the field. To do this you must consider the following:</p>

<li>Create a function to replaceAll - (replaces all instances found in a string)</li>
<li>What count as a link, to do this use the list link_types</li>

<p><strong>Update after comments</strong>: Since your data source is SharePoint, it seems like there is currently a bug in which filtering based on dates with SharePoint lists doesn't work. I don't know when this will be fixed, but there are a couple of workarounds that you can consider.</p>

<p>The first one is to create a calculated column in SharePoint that converts the date column into a text column, with an expression such as <code>=TEXT(PlacementDate,""yyyy-MM-dd"")</code>. You can then compare it with the date from the date picker in an expression like</p>

<pre><code>Filter(PortfolioApp, PlacementDateText = Text(DatePicker1.SelectedDate, ""yyyy-mm-dd""))
</code></pre>

<p>This should work if your list doesn't have a many elements (up to 500-2000 rows) as <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/delegation-overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">delegation</a> is not supported for calculated columns.</p>

<p>However, you also mentioned that you have >10k rows, so the previous workaround won't work. One other possible workaround is to have another ""regular"" text column that represents that same date value. You'll need to use some sort of script to backfill the existing values, and then use a flow to update that value every time a new row is added / modified. Not ideal, but that would work, at least until this bug is fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Common Data Service</strong> - this connector actually supports both versions of CDS, but it will be dependent based on the environment that you're in. So if you're in an environment that has a CDS1.0 database, it will connect by default to that environment. If you have a CDS2.0 database, it will connect by default to that environment.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental Connector</strong> - this is similar to the previous connector, but it includes experimental features in development by our team, and isn't recommended for production use. Generally you should only be using this connector if there is a specific feature we announce in the experimental connector you wish you use.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamics 365 Connector</strong> - this is similar to the base CDS connector, however it can only connect to CDS2.0 environments. It also has the ability to connect across environments. So you can be in Env1, but connect to a database in Env2. The normal CDS connector will only connect to the database within the environment you are building your app in.</p>

<p>Which one should you use? The Common Data Service connector is going to be your best option, it's where the most improvements are being released at the moment, and is designed to work best with PowerApps and Flow. </p>

<p>To connect to your Dynamics 365 environment, you'll want to make sure you start from web.powerapps.com and select that environment from the drop down in the top right, if you can't find your Dynamics 365 V9 environment - make sure you have system customizer permissions - if you do and you still can't see it, it may be an issue on our end. You can send me a message with your Dynamics org URL and we can check it for you.</p>

<p>Once you can select it from the environment drop down, you can then create a new app and use the Common Data Service connector, and it will connect directly to your Dynamics 365 data.</p>

First you will either want to recreate your table and in the table creator choose 'Editable' which will automatically place inputs in your table row vs labels. Alternatively you can just replace all your labels with Textboxes, Dropdowns, or whatever your input should be. See the image of the table creator below:</p>

<p>Since in my example I used a 'Insert Only' form I moved my 'Create Button' and my 'Clear Changes' button inside the formbody, then set the flow direction of the formbody to horizontal and then matched the spacing of the form fields to the same as my table row and dragged the formbody to be between the tableheader and the tablebody(list) element.

<p>Again you will want to make adjustments to fit your needs such as rearranging where your 'Save' and 'Reset' buttons appear and in manualsave mode you may be able to skip the formbody entirely since your 'Add Details' button should automatically create a new table row anyways which you will then be able to edit directly in the table, you may just need to find it first but generally new rows should just be added on the bottom of your current datasource page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note any function you define in a server script is open to all users of your application, even if you do not expose it in the UI. If you want to write a utility function that can only be called from other server scripts, you must append an underscore to the name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by appending an underscore to the function name, you are hiding it from the client, hence you are getting that error. In order to call the function using <code>google.script.run</code>, you must get rid of the <strong>underscore</strong>, i.e., the function <code>moveFiles_(sourceFileId, targetFolderId)</code> should be changed to <code>moveFiles(sourceFileId, targetFolderId)</code>.</p>

<p>If you feel you are exposing sensitive information to the client, then in this case, it's important to secure your scripts by implementing your own method. Take for example the following:</p>

<pre><code>function moveFiles(sourceFileId, targetFolderId, role) {    
   if(role === ""Manager"" || role === ""Admin""){
       var file = DriveApp.getFileById(sourceFileId);
       DriveApp.getFolderById(targetFolderId).addFile(file);
       return ""1"";
   }
 }

52825804,2,,52814608,2018-10-15T22:59:43.270,,2,,"<p>Based on your problem description, this is what I've done: <br><br></p>

<p>First, I have set up the models as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customer: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Project: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Milestone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><br>Second, I establish the relations as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customer</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(customer) ONE to MANY (milestone)</p></li>
<li><p>(customer) ONE to MANY (project)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Milestone</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(milestone) MANY to ONE (customer)</p></li>
<li><p>(milestone) MANY to ONE (project)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Project</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(project) MANY to ONE (customer)</p></li>
<li><p>(project) ONE to MANY (milestone)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><br> Third, I created a page, ""milestonePage"", that has the Milestone data model set. Inside that page, I inserted a <strong>table</strong>, and an <strong>insert</strong> form. The page looks like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev6pT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev6pT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>From here, the only thing left to do is to make sure that the bindings of the <strong>Customer</strong> dropdown and the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown are correct. By default, the <strong>Customer</strong> dropdown should have the following bindings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Options: <code>@datasources.customer.items</code></p></li>
<li><p>Value: <code>@datasource.item.customer</code> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the tricky one is the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown. Since you want to display the projects that belong to the selected customer, then you have to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the bindings for the <strong>Options</strong> and <strong>Value</strong></li>
<li><p>Make sure the new bindings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Options: <code>@widget.parent.descendants.Field2.value.project</code> (where <strong>Field2</strong> is the <strong>Customer dropdwon</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>Value: <code>@datasource.item.project</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> To avoid any confusion, add this to the <strong>onValueChange</strong> handler of the <strong>customer</strong> dropdown
<code>widget.parent.descendants.Field3.value = null;</code> (where <strong>Field3</strong> is the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown.)</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Pay attention to what Markus Malessa mentioned, about setting up the prefetches since it will be necessary.</p>

<p>You can put this script in the datasource server script or as a function that's called from the datasource server script as Markus suggested.</p>

  var page;
  do {
    page = AdminDirectory.Groups.list({
      domain: 'example.com',

    } else {
      Logger.log('No groups found.');
    }
    pageToken = page.nextPageToken;
  } while (pageToken);

<p>Then you can simply call the server script by using the following in the client scripting:</p>

});
</code></pre>

<p>to the client script, what you did was created a client script under the <strong>SCRIPTS</strong> section of App Maker and then added the code there. If that is so, that is why it's not working.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to use client scripting in the widget event handlers. Each widget has event handlers and the <strong>HTML</strong> widget is not an exception. What I recommend is to add the code to the <strong>onAttach</strong> event handler of the <strong>HTML</strong> widget:</p>

<p>Also, you can get rid of the <code>document.ready</code> part and just use the code you see in the image above. That should do the trick.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> If you will be using <em>classes</em> and <em>ids</em>, for it to work you will need to use the <strong>allowUnsafeHtml</strong> option:</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert an Add Picture control. By default, it is added as a group of controls: the AddMediaButton control itself, and an Image box that shows what's currently added.</li>
<li>Select the AddMediaButton (not the group). </li>

Basically to a void getting this strange error when when modifying an association on a record <code>TypeError: Cannot read property ""data"" from undefined</code> , I did the following:</p>

<p>Loop through the record relation(array) and and popup every record in side it. Then loop through the other records that you want to assign the record relation to ( modify the association ) pushing every element to the record relation. </p>

<pre><code>var length = record[relationNameAsVariable].length;
for(var i=0; i&lt;length; i++){
  record[relationNameAsVariable].pop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>now <code>record[relationNameAsVariable]</code> is empty so do the following:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0; i &lt; clientsArray.length; i++ ){
  record[relationNameAsVariable].push(clientsArray[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It could be a bug or something else that I'm doing wrong when trying to replace the whole association. I'm not sure. But this works like a champ.</p>

<ul>
<li>On the RequestList list on SharePoint, select the ""PowerApps -> Customize forms"" option that will bring you to the form in the PowerApps Studio (web editor).</li>
<li>Add a new data source (in the ribbon, View -> Data sources -> Add data source), that references the ApproverList list on the same SharePoint site</li>
<li>Select the card that represents the approver field in the list (it will likely be called <code>Approver_DataCard1</code> or something similar)</li>
<li>In the right-side pane, select the 'Advanced' tab, and click the padlock that says ""Unlock to change properties""</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we can start updating the properties that will perform the lookup. Click the ""More options"" button to show all properties of the card, and search for <code>Default</code>. Set its value to</p>

<pre><code>If
    IsBlank(DataCardValue3.Selected),
    Blank(),
    LookUp(
        ApproverList,
        Employee.Email = DataCardValue3.Selected.Email,
        ApprovingManager))
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>DataCardValue3</code> is the name of the control (a combo box control) that is used to select the employee for who the request is being made.</p>

<p>Now every time the employee is changed, it will look at the ApproverList on SharePoint for an employee whose e-mail is the same as the one for the selected employee.</p>

<p>If you don't want to give the form user the option to override the default approver, you can also update the <code>DisplayMode</code> property of the data card for the approver to <code>DisplayMode.View</code> so that it will only show the approver to the user, without letting them change it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>In your Confirmation Popup set a custom property of type Dynamic. For the purposes of this example call the property CallbackFn.</p>

<p>For the onClick event of your ConfirmButton in the popup set the following client script:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof widget.root.properties.CallbackFn === 'function') {
  widget.root.properties.CallbackFn();
}
widget.root.visible = false;
</code></pre>

<p>For the delete button in your datasource table set the following client script:</p>

<pre><code>deleteItem(widget.datasource);
</code></pre>

<p>In your scripts section add a client script or insert the following function under an existing client script:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteItem(datasource) {
  var popup = app.popups.ItemDeleteConfirmationDialog;

  popup.properties.CallbackFn = function() {
    datasource.deleteItem();
  };

  popup.visible = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since your delete button in your table is within a table row, you may need to change the function variable that you pass to the deleteItem() function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>deleteItem(widget.parent.parent.datasource);
</code></pre>

<p>If this doesn't work let me know. I have this set up in my own application with much more complex logic and I pass multiple variables in some cases to my deleteItem() function and it works great.</p>

Although its mentioned in documentation that there is a way to get current signed in user id ( which is Google Id), its not clearly stated how - maybe documentation could be improved here. Another problem is that in many occasions the email of current active user is referred to as the id for example in deprecated method <code>Session.getActiveUser().getUserLoginId()</code>. Anyways this is a proper way to get the id.</p>

<pre><code>var query = app.models.Directory.newQuery();
query.filters.PrimaryEmail._equals = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();
var result = query.run();
var GoogleId = result[0]._key;
</code></pre>

<p>So with this GoogleId you can safely relate different models with each other and not worry that database integrity might break if an already referenced user email is changed.</p>

<p>Relating the different models could be done simply by creating a model that acts as a wrapper model around the Directory model and storing GoogleId in it. Then linking that model to other models where you want to track user related data because unfortunately we can not directly link The Directory Model to other models.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><br>
In the line <code>var textField = widget.parent.descendants.TextArea1.getElement().children[1];</code> the part <code>widget.parent.descendants.TextArea1</code> represents the path to the TextArea widget, so depending on how you do things, it might be different for you.</p>

  var options = {
    includeSpamTrash: ""true"",
    pageToken: pageToken,
    maxResults: 50

      record.msgID = msgRecord[3];
      record.subject = msgRecord[2];
      record.senderAddress = msgRecord[1];
      record.msgDate = msgRecord[0];

      results.push(record);
    }

  return {records: results, nextPageToken: searchResult.nextPageToken};
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'll want to change your datasource query. You'll need to add a number parameter called <code>page</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var cache = CacheService.getUserCache();
var page = query.parameters.page || 1;
var pageToken;
if(page &gt; 1){
  pageToken = cache.get('pageToken' + page.toString());
}

var results = searchMessages('me', pageToken);

var nextPage = (page + 1).toString();
cache.put('pageToken' + nextPage, results.nextPageToken);

return results.records;

<p>You'll need to modify the pagination widget's various attributes. Here are the previous/next click functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For detailed information on this service, see the reference documentation for the Admin SDK Directory API. Like all advanced services in Apps Script, the Admin SDK Directory service uses the same objects, methods, and parameters as the public API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, we need to consult the <strong><a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users/update"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a></strong> to get clarification on how to achieve this.</p>

<p>The method requires at least two parameters: that means that the the first parameter is a user object resource and the second parameter is the email address of the user: <code>AdminDirectory.Users.update(resource, userKey)</code>. So you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>function getUser(user) {
    var userResource = {
        orgUnitPath: ""/""
    };
    var updated = AdminDirectory.Users.update(userResource, user);
    console.log(updated.primaryEmail);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So why do you need to specify the user email in the method when it is already being specified in the <code>userResource</code> object? Well, the email address in the <code>userResource</code> object would be the new value, in case you want to change the email address.</p>

<p>P.S. Perhaps you might wanna change the name of the function to something that is more of a match; <code>updateUser()</code> perhaps? I hope this helps!</p>

<p>You have to inspect it really close and you may see what @Philippe said: Look at the <code>redirect_uri</code> field, but if you watch closely, you can see that after the ending (i.e: ""apim.net"") there's an encoded character (%2f) which represents a forward slash. After that, comes a string ('redirect') which completes the URL and made the connector work.</p>

<em>IsAttached can be any name you want, this is just the variable name you decide</em></p>

<pre><code>var relatedrecord = app.models.Model_A.getRecord(record.Model_A._key);
relatedrecord.STATUS = ""BOSS_ACCEPT"";

<li>YMMV, but in general PowerApps is easier than a programming-language based platform for building apps. It won't be as powerful as the latter, but for the specific example that you mentioned (data input, presentation), it should be fine. Take a look at <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/#pivot=home&amp;panel=maker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>, especially in the section about <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/app-from-sharepoint"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">creating an app automatically from your data</a> (the link talks about apps from SharePoint, but the same works for SQL Server as well)</li>
<li>Yes, data integration is built in the platform, and SQL Server (both SQL Azure and on-premises installations of SQL Server) is supported</li>
<li>As always, it depends (which is why this question may be closed for being primarily opinion-based). A full-fledged programming language will always have more power than a ""no-code/low-code"" solution such as PowerApps, but if what you need to do is within the domain of that solution, it will likely be easier to implement. PowerApps also makes it easier to deploy the app in mobile devices (iOS / Android), which is not as easy to do with VB.NET, but again, that depends on your scenario.</li>

<li>""function"" or ""API"" ones (not an official name, how I like to call them), in which you need to call a function to retrieve a value. For example: <code>Office365.GetEmails</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Currently you can only create custom connectors in the second type, so you cannot, for example, have a custom connector where you would choose a table or some other value.</p>

<p>You can, however, create a custom connector that takes an API key, and when a maker needs to create a new connection, they will need to pass that value, and you can use that value in your API, even if not as a key.</p>

<p>For example, in the API created with the OpenAPI file listed below, it defines an API key called <code>CustomValue</code> which is passed in the request header, so when you try to create a connection, it will ask you for that, as seen below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pw0pm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pw0pm.png"" alt=""Add new connection""></a></p>

<p>Now every request made from that connection will have the value that you used to create the connection in the header, and it can be read from your custom API to implement your logic.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. You can also create a new feature request in the <a href=""https://aka.ms/powerapps-ideas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerApps Ideas board</a> to enable this functionality without going through this workaround of using a (fake) security key.</p>

<li>It is also easier to control the security environment on the server.

53840728,2,,53737720,2018-12-18T20:40:43.257,,0,,"<p>If you have the exact same columns/fields for the two lists, then Ryan's solution would work. However, if some of the fields are different (either their name or type), then you can use <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-table-shaping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of the many functions that can help you change the ""table shapes""</a> in PowerApps.</p>

<p>In your specific case, if you have the following two lists in SharePoint:</p>

<ul>
<li>List01

<ul>
<li>Title (Text)</li>
<li>Status (Text)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>List02

<ul>
<li>Title (Text)</li>
<li>Status (Choice)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Then you can create a collection with the contents of both lists by using this expression:</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(
    ItemsCollection,
    ShowColumns(
        AddColumns(List01, ""StatusText"", Status),
        ""Title"", ""StatusText""));
Collect(
    ItemsCollection,
    ShowColumns(
        AddColumns(List02, ""StatusText"", Status.Value),
        ""Title"", ""StatusText""));
</code></pre>

<p>The expression above creates a new column (*) called 'StatusText' on both lists, normalizing the type of the Status column to text, and then select the Title and StatusText columns from the two lists, thus ensuring that the schema (types of the fields) are the same.</p>

<p>(*) The AddColumns function doesn't create any additional columns in the SharePoint list; instead, it returns a new ""virtual"" table that can be used within expressions / controls in PowerApps.</p>

<p>Couple random ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You'd be doing that in a trigger? So your ""describe"" could happen only once. You don't need to describe every single field, you need only one operation outside of trigger's main loop.</p>

<p><code>Set&lt;String&gt; fieldNames = Account.sObjectType.getDescribe().fields.getMap().keyset();
System.debug(fieldNames);</code></p>

<p>This will get you ""only"" field names but that's enough. You don't care whether they're picklists or dates or what. Use that with generic <code>sObject.get('fieldNameHere')</code> and it's a good start.</p></li>
<li><p>or maybe without describe at all. sObject's <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_methods_system_sobject.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>getPopulatedFieldsAsMap()</code></a> will give you cool Map which you can easily iterate &amp; compare.</p></li>
<li><p>or <code>JSON.serialize</code> the old &amp; new version of the object and if they aren't identical - you know what to do. No idea if they'll always serialise with same field order though so checking if the maps are identical might be better</p></li>
<li><p>do you really need to hand-craft this field history tracking like that? You have 1M records free storage but it could explode really easily in busier SF org. Especially if you have workflows, processes, other triggers that would translate to multiple updates (= multiple trigger runs) in same transaction. Perhaps normal field history tracking + chatter feed tracking + even salesforce shield (it comes with 60 more fields tracked I think) would be more sensible for your business needs.</p></li>

This means that it is not possible to duplicate triggers since each one will have a unique id, which you can get by calling the method <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/trigger#getUniqueId()"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">getUniqueId()</a>.</p>

<p>So in your example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lets say accidentally a button with a function that creates a trigger was clicked twice </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two triggers performing the same thing will be created. So ideally, the best thing to do is to create a trigger and save the unique id to an <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties#setpropertykey-value"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apps script property</a> using a unique name. For example:  </p>

<pre><code>var emailTrigger = ScriptApp.newTrigger(""sendEmailReport"").timeBased().everyHours(2).create();
var triggerId = emailTrigger.getUniqueId();
PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty(""emailTriggerId"", triggerId)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you'll have to implement a way to check if the property already exists with a value. If it does, then you skip the creation of a new one. If it doesn't, then you proceed to create a new one. So in summary, it should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function createNewTrigger() {  
  var existingTrigger = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(""emailTriggerId"");
  if(!existingTrigger){
    var emailTrigger = ScriptApp.newTrigger(""sendEmailReport"").timeBased().everyHours(2).create();
    var triggerId = emailTrigger.getUniqueId();
    PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty(""emailTriggerId"", triggerId);
  } else {
    //return ""Trigger alredy exists"";
    //throw new Error(""Trigger alredy exists"");
  }    
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: To <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#deletetriggertrigger"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">delete the trigger</a>, you'll have to check if it already exists too. Something like this should get you in the right direction:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteTrigger(){
  var existingTrigger = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(""emailTriggerId"");
  if(existingTrigger){
    var allTriggers = ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers();
    for(var i=0; i&lt;allTriggers.length; i++){
      if(allTriggers[i].getUniqueId() === existingTrigger){
        ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(allTriggers[i]);
        break;
      }
    }
  } else {
    //return ""Trigger does not exists"";
    //throw new Error(""Trigger does not exists"";
    //createNewTrigger();
  }
}

<p>Also, our report stop returning records sometime after it grew beyond 110,000 records so it seems like they may have expanded the limit they had before.

So lets say your first set of parameters is Column1: Name, Query1: contains, Parameter1: John, then your datasource needs to have the following parameters Column1, Query1, and Parameter1 and your bindings on your dropdown1, dropdown2, and textbox1 should be:</p>

<pre><code>@datasource.query.parameters.Column1
@datasource.query.parameters.Query1
@datasource.query.parameters.Parameter1
</code></pre>

<p>respectively.</p>

<p>Then your query script needs to be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if (query.parameters.Field1 === null || query.parameters.Query1 === null) {
  throw new app.ManagedError('Cannot complete query without Parameters!');
}

switch (app.metadata.models.MaintenanceManagement.fields[query.parameters.Field1].type) {
  case 'Number':
    query.parameters.Parameter1 = Number(query.parameters.Parameter1);
    break;
  case 'Date':

    break;
  case 'Boolean':

}
query.where = query.parameters.Column1 + "" "" + query.parameters.Query1 + ""? :Parameter1"";

<p>What I am asking isn't possible with Calculated Models. How a Calculated Model works is the server script (query script) calls the external database, receives the data and formats (cleans up) the data following a Datasource. The datasource cleans up the data to fit within the Model before returning the data as Records to the 
Client. Once the data is on the Client everything on the serve is forgotten.</p>

<p>So to search the data 2 options I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create different Datasources, Models or Parameters that calls the external database every time and returning the filtered data to the Client.</p></li>
<li><p>Or use the javascript filter() method on the records already loaded to client and some extra code and ui to show the filtered results. The filter() method doesn't modify the records on the client but the results can shown on another table.</p></li>

<p><strong>The parent Controller Has the following nested function</strong></p>

<pre><code>@wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId', fields: CONTACT_FIELDS })

    if (data) {
        console.log('getRecord Data', JSON.stringify(data))

<p><strong>The Parent Component has c-debt-chart component andd its receiving data from the all-date-records:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
&lt;div class=""slds-page-header__row slds-accordion__content""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""c-container w-100""&gt;

&lt;template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Problem was that the examples on Salesforce dont show how to update the data in charts js. This is the solution I found using Getter and Setters</strong></p>

<p><strong>Child Component debt chart</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;lightning-card title=""Debt Overview"" icon-name=""standard:currency""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""slds-m-around_medium""&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/lightning-card&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Debt Chart Controller</strong></p>

<p>Every Time the variable allDateRecords changes at the parent level. It will trigger the child to update using the getter setter methods. This way on the setter method it will fire the seperateDateObject function which does some logic to update the chart.</p>

<pre><code>@api
get allDateRecords() {
    return this._allDateRecords;
}

set allDateRecords(value) {
    this._allDateRecords = value;
    this.separateDateObject();
}

<p>You are only providing one item instead of an array and this will yield unexpected results depending how your datasources are configured. However, when you do it via client script, you are pushing items into that array and matching the items length of the options datasource, hence it works.</p>

<p>The approach you are using its fine, except you'll have to reload the datasource everytime there is a change.

In Javascript, there is an operator called the <strong><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ternary operator</a></strong>.</p>

  <p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator

<p>AppMaker thinks that you are putting a ternary operator and is trying to hint you that the syntax is not correct, hence you see that error.</p>

<p>Now that we've understand the error, let's focus on your need. So you want to use a binding transformer to format the result value to show two decimals only. The problem with the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/api/transformers#formatNumber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#formatNumber</a> binding transformer is that it expects a primitive value <strong>double</strong> and you are providing an expression that evaluates to a number, which is not the same thing.</p>

  <p>The toFixed() method formats a number using fixed-point notation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A create datasource is a datasource used to create items in a particular data source. Its <strong>item</strong> property is always populated by a <strong>draft item</strong> which can be bound to or set programmatically. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you are trying to do is create three items off the same draft item. That why you see the result you get. If you want to create multiple items, you need to create a draft item for each one, hence all you need to do is put all your code inside the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0 ; i &lt; 3; i ++) {

  var ceateDatasource = app.datasources.Reservation.modes.create;
  var newItem = ceateDatasource.item;

  newItem.User = user; //'eric'
  newItem.Description = description; //'000'
  newItem.Location_Lab_fk = lab.value.Id; //'T'
  newItem.Area_fk = area.value.Id; //'L'
  newItem.Equipment_fk = equipment.value.Id; //'S'

  newItem.Start_Date = startDate;
  newItem.Start_Hours = '03';
  newItem.Start_Minutes = '00';

  newItem.End_Date = startDate;
  newItem.End_Hours = '23';
  newItem.End_Minutes = '30';

  // Create the new item
  ceateDatasource.createItem();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to save several records at the same time using client script, then what you are looking for is the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#manual_save_mode"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Manual Save Mode</strong></a>. So all you have to do is go to your model's datasource and click on the checkbox ""Manual Save Mode"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydq1O.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ydq1O.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then use the same code as above. The only difference is that in order to persist the changes to the server, you need to explicitly save changes. So all you have to do is add the following after the <em>for loop</em> block:</p>

<pre><code>app.datasources.Reservation.saveChanges(function(){
     //TODO: Callback handler
});

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>App Maker does support SQL using REST and JDBC <strong>however</strong> it is much harder than using their own CloudSQL model. some code for JDBC from when i last used it:</p>

<pre><code>function get_data() {
  var queryStr = 'SELECT * FROM users'; //SQL query
  var calcRecords = []; //empty array to put records into
  var connection = Jdbc.getConnection(dbUrl, user, userPwd); //connect to database
  var statement = connection.prepareStatement(queryStr); //prepared statement
  var results = statement.executeQuery(); //execute prepared query
  try {
    while (results.next()) {
      var calcRecord = app.models.test.newRecord();
      calcRecord.id = results.getInt(1); //data source test row id
      calcRecord.user = results.getString(2); //data source test row user
      calcRecord.passwd = results.getString(3); //data source test row passwd
      calcRecords.push(calcRecord); //append to 2D array
    }
    results.close(); //close the results
    statement.close(); //close the connection
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('SQL query failed: ' + err);
  }
  return calcRecords;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The equivalent Google Cloud SQL:</p>

<pre><code>function get_users(){
  var ds=app.datasource.Users.Items;
  var data = [];
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; Items.length; i++){
    tmp = [];
    tmp.push(Items[i].id); //the id
    tmp.push(Items[i].user); //the username
    tmp.push(Items[i].password); //the password
    data.push(tmp); //push to create 2D array
  }
  return data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing query is a little harder and requires server code (so async callbacks), but populating Widgets like dropdown and implementing tables is a lot easier, usually requiring a couple of clicks rather than a lot of code. </p>

<p>I know that you don‚Äôt want to use a template. In case you just want to create a PDF file with information retrieved from the application itself I would recommend to check the App Maker sample <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/email-pdf/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appmaker/samples/email-pdf/</a>. This sample contains a form and after you click on the button this takes the data entered on the app and send an email with the pdf generated from the application.</p>

<p>Now, for personal experience I prefer to use a template since you can customize the template and could send a personalized pdf file, however, this will depend on the purpose of why are you generating such pdf file. So here is my response based on my experience.</p>

<p>I used a Google Sheet template, to be able to modify such template I had to use the Spreadsheet Service <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/</a>. You will learn how to access to a Google Sheet and how to modify each cell from it, also how to modify specific sheets within the document.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://gist.github.com/primaryobjects/6370689c6f5fd3799ea53f89551eced7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/primaryobjects/6370689c6f5fd3799ea53f89551eced7</a> and gave me an idea how to create the pdf, this explains how to generate the pdf and store the pdf file into Google Drive. Also you have the idea how to send it through email using the App Maker sample above. This project is for a Google Sheet document, it creates an additional menu for you to export the current Google Sheet, you can use the Drive API to download the pdf if needed <a href=""https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads</a>.</p>

<p>I hope all this information was helpful to resolve your inquiry, I will try to find the app since I don‚Äôt have handy all the code and I have to check it again in order to provide samples here but hopefully this helps to find a way to achieve what you are looking for. I will search my code and will provide some examples as soon as I have more time to dive into my code since the app was created some time ago.</p>

<p>The most important thing to know is that you need to provide record IDs for each item in your csv to match them with existing records, otherwise Quickbase writes new records. You also need to format your clist properly. So...</p>

<p>You can narrow down what will be written by including Record IDs in your csv rows. If your csv contains Record IDs then only the matching Record IDs will be updated. You can optionally use <code>mergefield</code> instead of record ID. This is a new feature as of a few months ago.</p>

<p>If you need to update individual fields per record and exclude other fields, then specify only the fields that should get updated in the clist, ex: clist='3.7.11.31' (include record id so that it can match the existing records).</p>

<p>If you will have a mix of records and fields where some are supposed to be updated, and some aren't then you could go through the csv to import with something like javascript. For example: you can do <code>API_DoQuery</code> with a clist that matches your csv's clist (or <code>'a'</code> for all). Let the results of that API call be the csv you will upload later, then update that csv with the csv you want to upload. That way you'll have a copy of the data from Quickbase, and then with the updated values in your csv, do <code>API_ImportFromCSV</code>.</p>

<p>see the <a href=""https://help.quickbase.com/api-guide/importfromcsv.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> on using the API call for more help. </p>

<p>As for your question, you can't easily do that using Aggregates; if you need to, you'd add the Accounts Entity and join the Transaction Entity, using a Max() on the transaction date. However, you can't get the Id that way. You could also use a Max() on the Id, which should be consecutive, but there are situations they needn't be (depending on how the transactions are created).</p>

<p>Using SQL, you use a subquery with a join on Id, the subquery having a top 1 and sorted by date. But that's just standard SQL, not having much to do with OutSystems.</p>

<p>If you want to integrate powerapps with azure devops, you can follow the guide step by step:</p>

<p><a href=""https://veenstra.me.uk/2017/12/11/microsoft-teams-integration-with-visual-studio-team-services-using-powerapps/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft Teams ‚Äì Integration with Visual Studio Team Services using PowerApps.</a></p>

<p>Besides, AFAIK, PowerApps should not be ""Build/Deployed"" through Azure Devops.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are developing with PowerApps, there is no way to do Source
  Control. There are no source files. The only artifact you can version
  control is the .zip file that you can export.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In PowerApps, you don‚Äôt have to build your code. Any change you make
  to the application is live for you to test it. In that way it is very
  productive. To publish the application you just click on the publish
  button and it is live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check this great blog: <a href=""http://mscodingblog.blogspot.com/2019/01/powerapps-from-devops-perspective.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerApps From A DevOps Perspective</a> for some more details.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

The most complex answer is it depends on whether the beacon can be exposed to the world (Internet) as a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">custom connector</a> - there's currently no way to use bluetooth, for example, for communication between PowerApps and the external world.</p>

<p>If the beacon is Internet-connected, then it may be possible to use whatever the beacon is detecting (time, temperature, etc.) as a trigger in the custom connector. Once that is done, then you could create a <a href=""https://flow.microsoft.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flow</a> that is started based on that trigger, and the flow can send a push notification to PowerApps (or the flow can store the notification in some data source, and PowerApps can poll for new notifications). You'll also need to manage subscriptions (which apps / users can listen to which notifications from the beacons).</p>

<p>So, this may technically be possible (depending on the capability of the Minew, which I don't know), but it will involve some work to get it done.</p>

<li><p>Test in the Custom Connector ‚ÄúTest‚Äù area</p></li>

In VS code login using Salesforce CLI and rename the apex class and its reference by find &amp; replace class Name. and 
Rename the class in apex class folder to new name and deploy to org

<h2>The CSS</h2>

<p>1.) First, select the root widget of the page you are interested.

<p>2.) Now, that you have the page selected, let's move to the style editor. Once there, on the <strong>Page Style</strong> section just type a "".""(period, dot) and wait for the suggestions to appear. The first suggestion is what you need, so just press enter or select it with your cursor.</p>

<p>3.) Now that you have selected the element with a css selector, you can apply styling. For the background, you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>.app-myTestingPage-myPage {
  background: url(""url-to-picture"");
}

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8tgy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8tgy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the above example, <code>url-to-picture</code> represents that, a url to a an image, preferably if it is served over <strong>https</strong>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>The URL</h2>

<p>I know two ways in which you can get the background image url. The first one is to use any image url you find on the internet or a url hosted in your own server or cdn. The second way is to upload the image to appmaker resources and use that url. If you choose the latter, then do the following:</p>

<p>1.) Go to the app settings.</p>

<p>2.) Click on <strong>Resources</strong></p>

<p>3.) Drop your image file in the respected area or click the button to browse</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYZq8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYZq8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Once the resource finishes uploading, you can click the copy icon to copy the url to the resource and you can use that in your page css as the background url.</p>

56174295,2,,56159484,2019-05-16T18:07:26.473,,0,,"<p>I have some suggestions how to address this issue, although it is still unclear what exactly is causing the paging issue and whether or not my suggestions will fix the underlying issue. However, in my own application environment I have several instances where I use a standard SQL model and I apply filters to a datasource from that model and then have a concurrent calculated model (datasource) that returns the total count of records that meet the filters applied to my other datasource. Here we go:</p>

<p>Create a new datasource under your Employee model, leave it on the default 'Query Builder' type, adjust the query page size to your preference, but preferably to something that you know will return more than one page of records when querying the datasource. Uncheck the 'automatically load data' property unless you want to load all records when first going to your page where you set your filters. Do not enter anything in the query builder.</p>

<p>For the calculated datasource that you called Employee_RecordCount add your parameters, FirstName_equals, LastName_equals, Email_contains, StartDate_greaterequals, Age_lessequals, and Departments_equals, if you have not already. In this calculated model you should have a field called RecordCount. In the query script section of this datasource you should put your function as <code>return getEmployeeRecords_(query)</code>.</p>

<p>In your server script section where your getEmployeeRecords function is the code should be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function getEmployeeRecords_(query) {
 var params = query.parameters;
 var ds = app.models.Employee.newQuery();

 if (params.FirstName_equals !== null ) {
    ds.filters.FirstName._equals = params.FirstName_equals;
 }
 if (params.LastName_equals !== null ) {
    ds.filters.LastName._equals = params.LastName_equals;
 }
 if (params.Email_contains !== null) {
    ds.filters.Email._contains = params.Email_contains;
 }
 if (params.StartDate_greaterequals !== null) {
    ds.filters.StartDate._greaterThanOrEquals = params.StartDate_greaterequals;
 }
 if (params.Age_lessequals !== null) {
    ds.filters.Age._lessThanOrEquals = parseInt(params.Age_lessequals, 10);
 }
 if (params.Department_equals !== null) {
    ds.filters.Department.Department._equals = params.Department_equals;
 }
 var records = ds.run();

 // update calculated model with record count
 var calculatedModelRecord = app.models.Employee_RecordCount.newRecord();
 calculatedModelRecord.RecordCount = records.length;

 return [calculatedModelRecord];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now go to your search page, create a new panel or form set it to the same new datasource that you created. Make sure you have all your appropriate fields and change the binding of these fields to:</p>

<pre><code>@datasource.query.filters.firstName._equals
@datasource.query.filters.lastName._equals
@datasource.query.filters.email._contains
@datasource.query.filters.StartDate._greaterThanOrEquals
@datasource.query.filters.Age._lessThanOrEquals
@datasource.query.fitlers.Department.Department._equals
</code></pre>

<p>The button that initiates your search should have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var ds = widget.datasource;
ds.load(function() {
  app.showPage(app.pages.YourSearchResultPage);
}
var calculatedDs = app.datasources.Employee_RecordCount;
var props = calculatedDs.properties;
props.FirstName_equals = ds.query.filters.firstName._equals;
props.LastName_equals = ds.query.filters.lastName._equals;
props.Email_contains = ds.query.filters.email._contains;
props.StartDate_greaterequals = ds.query.filters.StartDate._greaterThanOrEquals;
props.Age_lessequals = ds.query.filters.Age._lessThanOrEquals;
props.Department_equals = ds.query.filters.Department.Department._equals;
calculatedDs.load();
</code></pre>

<p>Now go to your search result page and make sure the you have the following elements:</p>

<ol>
<li>A panel that the datasource is set to Employee_RecordCount. Inside
this panel create a label and set the binding to
<code>@datasource.item.RecordCount</code>.</li>
<li>A table that has the datasource set
to the same datasource as created in the first step. Make sure your
table has 'pagination' turned on.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should be all, and this works in my application. It is a pain to set up, but I'm afraid it is the only workaround to have a total count of records. I should note that I have never had any paging issues either.</p>

It is very important that you understand the difference between the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event handler and the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler.</p>

<p>The <strong>onValueChange</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This script will run on the client whenever the value property of this widget changes. The widget can be referenced using parameter widget and the new value of the widget is stored in newValue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>onValueEdit</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This script will run on the client whenever the value of this widget is edited by the user. The widget can be referenced using parameter widget and the new value of the widget is stored in newValue. Unlike onValueChange(), this runs only when a user changes the value of the widget; it won't run in response to bindings or when the value is set programmatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>

<p>Since your logic is set on the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event handler, this will be triggered everytime the <strong>dateBox</strong> widget value is changed, even programmatically; Hence, <code>form.otDateBox.value = null;</code> is triggering the logic over and over again. The reason why it is being triggered over and over again is due to your comparison logic:</p>

<pre><code>if(otdate &lt;= pastdate)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the value of <strong>otdate</strong> has become <strong>null</strong> wich when converted to number <code>Number(null)</code> the value is <strong>0</strong>(zero). The value of <strong>pastdate</strong> is obviously a number greater than zero, eg <strong>1555413900712</strong>. So obviously, zero is less than or equal to 1555413900712 and that is why you are triggering an infinite loop.</p>

<p>So, in summary, there is only one way to fix this. Set the logic inside the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler instead of the <strong>onValueChange</strong>.</p>

<p>Start with running built-in tools that should give you some degree of overview:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup -> Storage Usage (so you'll see which objects have 0 records)</li>
<li>Setup -> Optimizer (produces a massive PDF but good overview of over-configured areas which might be maintenance pain, users who don't log in too often, unused reports...)</li>
<li>(At end of Optimizer report you should have bunch of resources / links for example to tool that analyses usage of custom fields, how many % are actually populated)</li>
<li>Setup -> Lightning Experience Transition Assistant -> Get Started -> Discover Phase -> Evaluate... -> Check Readiness. Horrible, I know. But will tell you which Visualforce pages were accessed most recently. Or which buttons aren't on page layouts so if people can't click to get to a VF page - they probably can't run it and could be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren't pixel-perfect, SF confirmed to me that Optimizer looks only at certain standard objects &amp; custom ones but not all (I had significant problems hidden in std object that isn't checked, had to pull info from SF backend manually) but it's a start. </p>

<p>In another question you wrote you don't have any developer tools (Eclipse IDE, VScode etc), just dev console. This will limit your ability to just search the project for references to class X... On VF pages ""Where is this used"" should help you a bit. There are some browser plugins you might want to check out (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-advanced-code/lnkgcmpjkkkeffambkllliefdpjdklmi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-advanced-code/lnkgcmpjkkkeffambkllliefdpjdklmi</a>) or there might be some SF plugins on AppExchange...</p>

<p>Where to start writing unit tests?  Heh :) Ideally business would be able to point you in general direction of functionality that most often changes / breaks / is most critical and therefore would benefit from nice harness of tests so maintenance developer won't break functionality. </p>

<p>Failing that you can choose to focus on top 10 classes that have most non-covered lines (attacking them should give you quickest coverage % gains). What I'm trying to say if you have class that has 60 / 100 lines covered by test and another that has 2 / 4 covered - it's better to attack the 1st one, even though it has higher coverage %. 
After running all tests in go to Developer Console -> Query Editor. On the bottom tick the checkbox for Tooling API. Query similar to this should be a good start:</p>

FROM ApexCodeCoverageAggregate

In this method, maintain a counter to keep track of the number of times the method was invoked and return the value. In LWC1, invoke this method and decide whether to render the UI based on the returned value. You can, thus, control how many instances of the component you want rendered on the page at one time. However, note that you won't be able to control which instance is rendered i.e the any of the instances of the component could be rendered at random.

<p>I ended up making the whole function <strong>selectedValueChanged</strong>() ""<em>asynchronous</em>"" by using the <strong>setTimeout</strong> trick.</p>

<p>One solution that worked for me was the following:</p>

<pre><code> function selectedValueChanged() {

    var e = document.getElementById(""record_id_select"");
    var value_selected = e.value;
    var CO_picked_record_id = parseInt(value_selected);
    var query_CO_line_details = ""{'""+related_CO_fid+""'.EX.'""+CO_picked_record_id+""'}"";
    var records = getRecords(table_CO_line_details_DBID,query_CO_line_details);
    var data_array = createArrayFromRecordsDrilled(records,CO_detail_record_categories);
    var table_div = tableCreate(data_array,'table_container_1',""Please Enter Quantities"",headerList);
    $('#table_container_1').replaceWith(table_div);

     }
    }

     function loadingSelectedValueChanged(callbackFunct){

         setTimeout(function(){
             callbackFunct()

     }

     function selectedValueChangedUP() {

      $('#curtain').show(); 
      loadingSelectedValueChanged(selectedValueChanged);
   }
</code></pre>

<p>And now instead of calling <strong>selectedValueChanged</strong>, I call <strong>selectedValueChangedUP</strong>.</p>

<p>What <strong>SetTimeout</strong> does is to execute the function that receives as parameter after a given amount of time. This process is done in an ""<em>asynchronous</em>"" way.</p>

<pre><code>function print(widget, title){
  var win = window.open('', 'printWindow', 'height=600,width=800');
  win.document.children[0].children[0].innerHTML = ""&lt;title&gt;""+title+""&lt;/title&gt;"";
  win.document.children[0].children[1].innerHTML = ""&lt;body&gt;""+widget.getElement().innerHTML+""&lt;/body&gt;"";
  win.print();
  win.close();
}  
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing about the approach above is that it lacks style, since the form will be rendered without any css and thus you might not want to print something like that. To improve that, you can insert the materialize css via CDN like this:</p>

<pre><code>function print(widget, title){
  var win = window.open('', 'printWindow', 'height=600,width=800');
  var css = document.createElement(""link"");
  css.setAttribute(""href"", ""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css"");
  css.setAttribute(""rel"",""stylesheet"");
  win.document.children[0].appendChild(css);
  win.document.children[0].children[0].innerHTML = ""&lt;title&gt;""+title+""&lt;/title&gt;"";
  win.document.children[0].children[1].innerHTML = ""&lt;body&gt;""+widget.getElement().innerHTML+""&lt;/body&gt;"";
  setTimeout(function(){
    win.print();
    win.close();
  },500);
}  
</code></pre>

<p>That should render a more decent form for you to print out. Furthermore, that will not print out the values of the form fields and that is because of App Maker bindings. In order to get the field values to print, you'll have to programmatically build the html elements. So you need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function print(widget, title){
  var htmlContent = """";
  var fields = widget.children.{formNameBody}.descendants._values;
  fields.forEach(function(field){
    var label = field.getElement().getElementsByTagName(""label"")[0];
    htmlContent += label.outerHTML;    
    var input = field.getElement().getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0];
    var fieldVal = field.value;  
    input.setAttribute(""value"", fieldVal);
    htmlContent += input.outerHTML;
  });
  var win = window.open('', 'printWindow', 'height=600,width=800');
  var css= document.createElement(""link"");
  css.setAttribute(""href"", ""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css"");
  css.setAttribute(""rel"",""stylesheet"");
  win.document.children[0].appendChild(css);
  win.document.children[0].children[0].innerHTML = ""&lt;title&gt;""+title+""&lt;/title&gt;"";
  win.document.children[0].children[1].innerHTML = ""&lt;body&gt;""+htmlContent+""&lt;/body&gt;"";
  setTimeout(function(){
    win.print();
    win.close();
  },500);
}

<ol>
<li>The binding in your follow-up comment -- <code>@datasources.Services.items</code> -- won't work for a multiselect, because it represents the entire set of records in your Services datasource. The binding that Markus suggests is what projects to grab just the names of each of the items. If you are trying to present the <code>name</code> as the human-readable choice but use the <code>id</code> as the value you're going to do something with, then you'll want this:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>widget.names = @datasources.Service.items..name;
widget.options = @datasources.Service.items..id;
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>The multiselect options property represents the possibilities for the values property, and the values property represents the options that have been selected. They are each set as an array. The stuff in 1. above gets you the right set of options but doesn't deal with values. If you want to present particular values as selected or not, you'll either need to:

<ul>
<li>Pass in values from another datasource, turned into an array. This would be if you're reading the values from a specific field in another record. So if you had a User datasource, and the User had a Services field, you might get the existing selections from the User record like this: <code>@datasources.User.item.Services#strToArray()</code>; or</li>
<li>Set the values programmatically. This would be if you're doing something else behind the scenes to generate the pre-selected values. So if your Service datasource has six things in it that are potential options, but only some of them should be selected, your script would contain something like this: <code>widget.values = [selection1, selection5, selection6];</code></li>

<p>From what I remember custom lookups from lead aren't available in the W2L form. Only Campaign is. And it renders to similar HTML:</p>



<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;label for=""Campaign_ID""&gt;Campaign&lt;/label&gt;&lt;select  id=""Campaign_ID"" name=""Campaign_ID""&gt;&lt;option value=""""&gt;--None--&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=""701700000005lMn""&gt;International Electrical Engineers Association Trade Show - Mar 4-5, 2002&lt;/option&gt;

<p>For that reason, this structure is and should be used rarely in Apex code, and only for those code elements that absolutely cannot be executed in a unit test. One example is the <code>addFields()</code> call sometimes used in a Visualforce controller's constructor, which is not allowed in test context.</p>

<p>It is very rare to see more than one line of code guarded this way, and it makes me suspect the code is badly architected. With only a single line of code guarded, you can still get code coverage to 100% by writing the <code>if</code> and its body on a single line:</p>

<pre><code>if (!Test.isRunningTest()) controller.addFields(new List&lt;String&gt; { 'Name' });
</code></pre>

<p>So long as the <code>if</code> test is run in a test, the entire line is counted as covered.</p>

<p>It used to be common to use this pattern to block callouts. In modern code, Mocks should be used instead.</p>

In this collection you would have two extra values: an empty (the first element in your scenario) and 'Add new item', in addition to the elements that you want to show. For example, if the data source with the options has two columns, Id (type GUID) and Text (type Text), then you can initialize the collection as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(myDropdownItems, { Id: Blank(), Text: """" });
Set(IdForAddNewItem, GUID(""11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111""));
Collect(myDropdownItems, { Id: IdForAddNewItem, Text: ""Add new item"" });
Collect(myDropdownItems, &lt;the data source with the current options&gt;)

<p>Now you can set the OnChange property of the dropdown so that if the selected value is 'Add new item', then you would show a dialog / navigate to a different screen where the user can enter the new option.

56582225,2,,56577667,2019-06-13T14:00:35.660,,0,,"<p>Creating a lot of records via client script is not recommended, especially if you loose connection or the app gets closed by mistake. In my opinion, the best way to handle this would be via <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/server#creating_records"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">server script</a> for two things: First, It's more reliable and second, it's faster. As in the example from the official documentation, to create a record you need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Assume a model called ""Fruits"" with a string field called ""Name"".
var newRecord = app.models.Fruits.newRecord();
newRecord.Name = ""Kiwi"";  // properties/fields can be read and written.
app.saveRecords([newRecord]);  // save changes to database.
</code></pre>

<p>The example above is a clear example on how to create only one record. To create several records at once, you can use a <code>for</code> statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>  function createRecordsInBulk(){
    var newRecords = [];
    for(var i=0; i&lt;19; i++){
        var newRecord = app.models.Fruits.newRecord();
        newRecord.Name = ""Kiwi "" + i;
        newRecords.push(newRecord);
    }
    app.saveRecords(newRecords);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, you initiate <strong>newRecords</strong>, an empty array that will be responsible for holding all the new records to create at once. Then using a <code>for</code> statement, you generate 19 new records and push them into the <strong>newRecords</strong>. Finally, once the loop is finished, you save all the records at once by using <strong>app.saveRecords</strong> and passing the <strong>newRecords</strong> array as an argument.</p>

<p>Now, all this is happening on the server side. Obviously you need a way to call this from the client side. For that, you need to use the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/client#call_a_server_script"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google.script.run</a> method. So from the client side you need to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>  google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
      app.datasources.Fruits.load();
  }).createRecordsInBulk();
</code></pre>

<p>All this information is clearly documented on the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">app maker official documentation site</a>. I strongly suggest you to always check there first as I believe you can get a faster resolution by reading the documentation.</p>

<p>To implement it, I updated the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the date picker - which in my app is called <code>DatePicker1</code> - itself (to change its border to red when there is a problem), set the <code>BorderColor</code> property to <code>If(DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today(), Color.Red, RGBA(0, 18, 107, 1))</code></li>
<li>In the label behind the picker, set its <code>Visible</code> property to <code>DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today()</code></li>
<li>In the button that the user would click to perform an action with the selected date, set its <code>DisplayMode</code> property to <code>If(DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today(), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)</code></li>

56633525,2,,56615245,2019-06-17T14:35:50.830,,1,,"<p>I have found the easiest way to create related items for situations such as yours is to actually import a form with the datasource set to <code>Parent: Child (relation)</code> or <code>Parent: Child (relation) (create)</code>. So in your case the datasource would need to be set to <code>Order: Order_Items (relation)</code>.</p>

<p>You can get this accomplished in two different ways using the form widget wizard:</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your page datasource is set to Order_Items, drag your form on your page.</li>
<li>In the datasource selection section, your datasource in the form widget should default to `Inherited: Order_Items'. Click the 'Advanced' button in the bottom left corner, then from the datasources category find Order as your datasource, then select relations in the next field, and then Order_Items in the next field, choose 'Insert only' or 'Edit' form and then the appropriate fields you want in the form.</li>
<li>Now every item that gets created in that form will automatically be a child record of the currently selected record in your Order datasource.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your page datasource is set to Order, drag your form on your page.</li>
<li>In the datasource selection section, your datasource in the form widget should default to <code>Inherited: Order</code>. Scroll down in your datasource selection section until you find <code>Order: Order_Items (relation)</code>, then choose 'Insert only' or 'Edit' form and then the appropriate fields you want in the form.</li>
<li>Now every item that gets created in that form will automatically be a child record of the currently selected record in your Order datasource.</li>
</ol>

<p>In your Order model, make sure that the security setting is set appropriately that a user is allowed to create relations of Order_Items in Order. That is the simplest approach in my opinion since you don't have to hard code the parent into your form or client/server scripts. It is automatically based on the currently selected parent, and is essentially doing the same thing that @Morfinismo explained in the client script section.</p>

One thing you can do is to either run Fiddler or open the browser Developer Tools to see the network traffic when you try to save the form data. If you see a network request being made to SharePoint (might be a POST call to *.azure-apim.net/invoke), then you can check the response to see what error is being returned by SharePoint. If you do not see a call going out to SharePoint, then validation on PowerApps' end may be failing and blocking the request from going out to SharePoint.</p>

<p>Historically, I have seen issues with SharePoint form apps when users try to customize the form by editing/adding fields in the form control.

<p>By adding this code you are filtering your directory by your current user and prefetching the Property relation table, then you set the filter only if your user canviewallRecords is false and use JS map function to create an array of the PropertyName field in the Property table.

<p>Google Support does not refuse to help. They don't accuse you of being a hacker. Google Support can look at the project and see if you have credentials in the project and if you do they can explain how to authorize yourself. However, Google Support requires a support agreement, which is not free. If you do not have one, then you are not entitled to technical support only billing support. Look up your billing account ID and send a request for billing support. Your billing account will also show you which projects are linked to your billing account.</p>

<p>The issue is that you are trying to access the wrong Project ID. Figure out what is the correct Project ID. If you have the Cloud SDK installed execute this command <code>gcloud projects list</code> and this will tell you which projects your credentials have access to.</p>

<p>Suppose the first dropdown is named <strong>primaryDropdown</strong> and the second dropdown is called <strong>secondaryDropdown</strong>. In the <strong>primaryDropdown</strong> options set the following:</p>

<pre><code>[""Vanilla"", ""Chocolate""]
</code></pre>

<p>Also, make sure to uncheck the option <strong>allowNull</strong> and on the <strong>onAttach</strong> event handler, place the following:</p>

<pre><code>widget.value = ""Vanilla"";
</code></pre>

<p>Now we move on to the <strong>secondaryDropdown</strong>. Here, we will do a binding so place the following in the options value:</p>

<pre><code>getAvailableOpts(@widget.root.descendants.primaryDropdown.value)
</code></pre>

<p>In the client script, we need to make sure that function exists so please paste the following in any client script:</p>

<pre><code>function getAvailableOpts(primaryValue){

  var options;

  switch(primaryValue){
    case ""Vanilla"":
      options =[""Strawberry"",""Buttercream""];
      break;
    case ""Chocolate"":
      options = [""Mocha"",""Dark Chocolate"",""Buttercream""];
      break;
    default:
      options = [];
  }

  return options;

}
</code></pre>

<p>From here, you are good; However we can still make it better. For that, make sure to also uncheck the <strong>allowNull</strong> option for the <strong>secondaryDropdown</strong> and then we need to add some logic in the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event handler of the <strong>primaryDropdown</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Here's why:</strong></p>

<p>When authorizing for multiple scopes, I get the error seen at the end of my question:

<p>The connection proceeds properly, and I can remotely execute functions that utilize only that one scope successfully. This does work for any one scope that I authorize. The only problem is, it's a rare occurrence that a script only requires one scope. While this I can get around this major bug, I cannot remotely execute my function that adds gmail labels to all users in an organization because it requires two scopes. This will be mentioned to the development team and it should be fixed soon.</p>

The HTML is simple - how you make this work using App Maker is up to you.  I know that App Maker will allow arbitrary HTML, so getting this to work shouldn't be too hard.</p>

<p>At the position on your page that you want the user to be able to jump to, you need to create an 'anchor tag' - which looks the same as any other anchor tag, except that it includes a 'name' instead of a url:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a name=""jumpto""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now, to create a link which will jump to 'jumpto' you create another anchor tag around your icon that will work like any other link, except that it will jump to the named location in your page instead of jumping to another site on the www:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""#jumpto""&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

Also, while the above code worked for me to load the FullCalendar plugin into a Lightning Web Component, I couldn't get <strong>selectable: true</strong> to work, even after importing the <strong>interaction</strong> plugin.

You really don't have a choice here if your users are savvy. As soon as you share an app that has SQL Credentials with them, they can create their <strong>own PowerApp</strong> and reuse the ConnecTION with whatever permissions the SQL User for the ConnecTION has. </p>

<p>One thing I've seen people do is:</p>

</ol>

<p>I don't particularly like this method because the AD Connector doesn't have any way to authenticate users. User just passes it an email address.</p>

<p>This does not mitigate the shared ConnecTION issue noted above, but may give you some piece of mind.</p>

<p>Another option that comes to mind is to only give the PowerAppsSql user Read access to the database. Force the user write to a Sharepoint list instead, then use Flow under <strong>your creds</strong> to Write to the DB (Crazy work around, I know, but I'm trying to help here :) ).</p>

<li><p>I noticed that on the <a href=""http://script.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google scripts</a> page, when accessing the project in question selecting ""Preview"", it was missing the following OAuth:
<a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly</a>
The functioning deployed version did not have this missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Still in the Preview, I selected ""Stackdriver (logs)"", which gave me an error that the project had been deleted.  The actual wording was:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Access forbidden</p>

<p>Project XXXX is shut down and scheduled to be deleted.  A project owner can cancel the shutdown on the projects list page.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>Clicking on the link in the error ""Go to projects list page"" brought me to a page with the title ""Resources pending deletion"", which did not load a list of projects (but otherwise fully loaded) and would display the spinning wheel in perpetuity.  I attempted this multiple times, including leaving it overnight once.</p></li>
<li><p>Support presumed that I had deleted the GCP project, although I honestly don't/didn't think I had.  I also confirmed that creating new previews did not work, but creating new deployments did.  I also confirm(ed) that this particular App Maker app did not require (eg) a GCP SQL database.</p></li>
<li><p>Support pointed me toward the following website: <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/undelete"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google undelete project</a> and I was asked to follow these steps (copy-pasted here):</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. For projectId, enter your project ID. From the screenshot you provided, this is ""XXX (redacted)"" (the quotes are just to emphasise the project ID, you shouldn't enter them.</p>

<p>b. Click EXECUTE.</p>

<p>c. You'll be prompted to grant authorisation, which may be preceded by a prompt to choose your admin account. Please do so.</p>

<p>d. You should receive a 200 response, with an empty body, that is {}.</p>

<p>e. Attempt to access the project via <a href=""https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/settings?project=XXX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project link</a> (with the actual project id redacted here).</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>The above yielded some strange behaviour:</li>
</ol>

<p>a. undeleteing the project gave it a different name that the App Maker app;</p>

<p>b. I notice that I had 3 other projects all called correctly (the App Maker app name).</p>

<p>c. When asked to reauthorize, I was provided with yet another project name (""Untitled project""), which was different from the correct one and different from the one in para. 7a, above.</p>

<p>d. I then also obtained another error in a new window which read:</p>

<ol start=""401"">
<li>That's an error</li>
</ol>

<p>Request Details
(a bunch of stuff)
That's all we know.</p>

<ol start=""8"">
<li>Support advised that there may be a propagation issue, and that I should wait up to 30 minutes.  I did, and it then worked!  The only weird thing was the project name was wrong, but it was only for the preview, so I didn't really care.</li>
</ol>

<p>If anyone needs additional information, I can PM screenshots I took along the way.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$A.enqueueAction(action) adds the server-side controller action to the
  queue of actions to be executed. All actions that are enqueued will
  run at the end of the event loop. Rather than sending a separate
  request for each individual action, the framework processes the event
  chain and batches the actions in the queue into one request. (...) The
  framework batches the actions in the queue into one server request.
  The request payload includes all of the actions and their data
  serialized into JSON. The request payload limit is 4 MB.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The framework queues up actions before sending them to the server.
  This mechanism is largely transparent to you when you‚Äôre writing code
  but it enables the framework to minimize network traffic by batching
  multiple actions into one request (XHR). The batching of actions is
  also known as boxcar‚Äôing, similar to a train that couples boxcars
  together.</p>
  
  <p>The framework uses a stack to keep track of the actions to send to the
  server. When the browser finishes processing events and JavaScript on
  the client, the enqueued actions on the stack are sent to the server
  in a batch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this doesn't work as described for you (can you post some code?) and request size is &lt; 4 MB... Maybe they broke something and you've found a platform bug. You're sure you see separate entries in Debug Log? Or in network traffic monitoring in browser?</p>

<p>Maybe you need to play with <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/controllers_server_background_actions.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">background actions</a>. I mean this is supposed to work without extra crutches in Apex to bundle multiple calls into one, create complex response wrapper class and every callback unpicks only data it cares about, that's lots of unneccessary code :/</p>

<p><strong>Do this:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure the Flow has the correct JSON response before proceeding</li>
<li>Add <code>ClearCollect(colResponse, myFlow.apiRequest())</code> Function to a Button Control in the PowerApp</li>
<li>Execute the API call (click the button)</li>
<li>Inspect <code>colResponse</code> (View/Collections) to ensure it has content</li>
<li>Insert a blank Gallery Control</li>
<li>Set its <code>Items</code> Property to <code>colResponse</code></li>
<li>Insert a TextBox Control into the Gallery</li>
<li>Set its <code>Text</code> Property to <code>ThisItem.&lt;someColumn&gt;</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the shape of your JSON response (flat or nested table), you may have to do some wrangling. </p>

<p><strong>There are 3 areas to focus your wrangling:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the <code>ClearCollect</code> Function.</p>

<p>a. Add some dot notation to the end of this to ""dig"" into the API response before it hits the Gallery Control</p>

<p>b. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>ClearCollect(colResponse, myFlow.apiRequest()).someColumn</code></p></li>
<li><p>On the Gallery Control <code>Items</code> Property</p>

<p>a. Add some dot notation to the end of <code>colResponse</code> to ""dig"" into the Collection</p>

<p>b. <strong>Example:</strong> <code>colResponse.someColumn</code></p></li>
<li><p>On the TextBox Control within the Gallery</p>

<p>a. Add the <code>First()</code> Function to the <code>Text</code> Property</p>

<p>b. <strong>Example:</strong> `First(ThisItem.someColumn).someColumn2'</p>

<p>c. <strong>Note:</strong> There are some JSON schemas that require MULTIPLE <code>First()</code>'s to ""dig"" into the correct level. `First(First(ThisItem.someColumn).someColumn2).someColumn3' etc.</p></li>

<p>What you can do is to refresh the data source (<code>Refresh('[dbo].[your_table_name]')</code>), so that the cache will be updated with the latest data from the server.

<blockquote>
  <p>Because a table is a collection of other widgets, you can't use the Widget API to interact with a table. However, you can use scripts to manipulate the individual widgets that make up a table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above statement makes sense because the amount of rows a table will display depends on the datasource items; i.e., the rows are dynamically created when the widget datasource is loaded in the ui.

<ol>
<li>Create a Custom Connector to your REST endpoint (NOT token server)</li>
<li>Create a new Flow (named <code>finalDataCall</code>) with PowerApps as trigger</li>
<li>Create an HTTP Action to call the token server using a GET method</li>
<li>Add a parse JSON action to get the token alone</li>
<li>In Flow, add your Custom Connector as an Action. 

<ul>
<li>For all parameters <em>except</em> the token, choose ""Ask in PowerApps"".</li>
<li>Use the token parsed from the JSON above to pass in the token parameter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a Response Action in Flow to shape the response</li>

        queryParam3.Text,

Create a variable for startdate = new Date() at the beginning and then before you return the data do console.log(new Date() - startdate), which will give you the time difference in milliseconds of your total script execution.

That's why the <strong>Label</strong> widget that is on the table row get's updated, then it updates on the server. That is what is meant by </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Additionally, any change to a name on the server automatically updates the text displayed in the text box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is because it gives the effect that it changed on the server and afterwards on the client. In other words, the text box that you are using to put the new value, does not uses binding, hence you need to use client script to update the value on the client which then triggers an event to update the value on the server. </p>

<p>Now, when you perform the change using server script, the data in the client never updates because the record needs to reload. For that your script should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>function c(newvalue) {     
    google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(){
        console.log('ok');
        app.datasources.TheDatasource.item._reload();
    }).withFailureHandler(function(err){
        console.log(err);
    }).change(newvalue); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>In reality, the two way binding only refers to changes that happen in the client and reflects on the server. I believe the documentation wording should change to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Crawling up from the datepicker I noticed that the ""table cell"" contains a section element that has inline styling setting the z-index to 7002.

<p>Now there is a couple of changes you will need to implement. Since your page datasource is 'Software' and your 'Software anlegen' form presumably has a datasource of either 'Software' or 'Inherited: Software' I would encourage you to change the datasource for the 'Create Produkt_Commodity' to 'Inherited: Software' also. Then for your multiselect within 'Create Produkt_Commodity' form have a options binding of <code>@datasources.CommodityP.items</code> and a names binding of <code>@datasources.CommodityP..Name</code> and finally a value binding of <code>@datasource.item.Produkt_Commodity</code>.</p>

<p>Also, I would suggest in your 'Software' datasource setting to prefetch your 'Produkt_Commodity' relation and then also remove the 'Submit' button from the 'Create Produkt_Commodity' form as it is not needed. In fact you could get rid of that entire form and just incorporate your multiselect widget into your 'Software anlegen' form instead with the same bindings I already outlined. Also make sure to remove the onValuesEdit code that you had associated with your multiselect.</p>

var status = ""inside"";
google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(){

    record.status = status;

<p>The table building is based on a 2D array and the documentation is here <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/table</a>. But you will also need to remove your prebuilt table in favor of just appending a table instead. This way you are not dependent on the quantity of child records being fixed like they currently are in your document template. Also, the variable for childRecords may or may not work, I have not tested this since I am unsure if prefetch works in conjunction with <code>.getRecord(key)</code>. This may require some additional testing but hopefully this will provide enough guidance.</p>

<p>Thought I would add this as an alternative. Lets say you keep your table but remove all the rows with exception for the header row then you could still use DocumentApp service to add your rows to the table like so:</p>

<pre><code>var tableheaderfieldnames = ['Quantity_for_PO', 'Inventory_Item.id', 'Unit_Price']; //set a fixed table header with the field names, uncertain if the table header for the related inventory item will work or not
    var table = copyBody.getTables()[0];
    for (i in childRecords) {
      var row = table.appendRow();
      for (var j in tableheaderfieldnames) {
        row.appendTableCell(childRecords[i][tableheaderfieldnames[j]]);
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that AM does not allow you to use FK references, so for your inventory item that appears to use a fk field you may need to tinker around with setting the proper name reference for when you are trying to fill in the item in your table.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set your main panel datasource to Stages.</li>
<li>In your Stages datasource make sure you don't apply any filters, so
that all stages will show as in 'To Do/Doing/Done'.</li>
<li>Still in your Stages datasource set a prefetch for Tasks, then use
the 'Advanced' option under prefetch settings to prefetch
<code>Tasks.relations.Subtasks</code>.</li>
<li>Back to your main panel, drag in a new Grid or make sure your
existing grid datasource is set to 'Inherited: Stages'.</li>
<li>For reference purposes drag in a label and set the binding to
<code>@datasource.item.YourStagesName</code>, so it will reflect your correct
stage in each panel. Drag in a list widget into the grid cell and
set the datasource to 'Stages: Tasks (relation)'.</li>
<li>Drag in a list widget into the list row and set the datasource to
'Tasks: SubTasks (relation)'.</li>
</ol>

<p>Relatively speaking this should correct your issue but may require some additional testing. I did not test this setup myself but have successfully implemented something similar. The secret here is to prefetch all relations even if they are multiple levels deep by using the advanced prefetch option. Also keep in mind that the more tasks you have the more this process of prefetching multiple relations deep can slow down the performance of your app.</p>

<p>1.) Enable the directory model by creating it, I usually name it <strong>directory</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bC5M5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bC5M5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>2.) Next, go to the <strong>DATASOURCES</strong> section of the directoy model you just created and click on the <strong>ADD DATASOURCE</strong> button. I usually name this datasource <strong>activeUser</strong>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wq1we.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wq1we.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>3.) Add the following to any server script: </p>

<pre><code>function getActiveUser() {    
  var dirQuery = app.models.directory.newQuery();
  dirQuery.filters.PrimaryEmail._equals =  Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();
  var userResult = dirQuery.run();
  return userResult;     
}
</code></pre>

<p>4.) Go back to the <strong>activeUser</strong> datasource. Add the following to the <strong>Server Script Query</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>return getActiveUser();
</code></pre>

<p>And change the query page size to <strong>1</strong>.</p>

<p>5.) Now all you have to make sure is that the widget where you will print the user name has the datasource <strong>activeUser</strong> either directly or inherited. Then you simply bind it to the <strong>FullName</strong> property. </p>

It sounds as though you are supplying dates as strings in <code>dd.mm.yyyy</code> format (or something similar) but the browser is interpreting it as <code>mm.dd.yyyy</code>. You may even be seeing a warning in the browser console which relates to this. </p>

<p>If you send the date as a string the browser has no way to know whether you meant 10th Sept or 9th Oct, so it just has to guess. </p>

<p>Background: some cultures (e.g. UK and much of Europe) use <code>dd.mm.yyyy</code>, some use <code>mm.dd.yyyy</code> (e.g. USA) to present dates (to human beings), some use something else again. There's variation in the order of the elements, the separators used, and the conventions for when to use particular formats in different situations. As you've now learned, it's a bad idea to tie your data to one of these idiosyncratic formats. Computers cannot guess which culture you are intending to represent with your data.</p>

<p>Whilst it's certainly possible to tell the browser how to correctly interpret your ambiguous date, the simple, foolproof solution to this is not to use ambiguous date formats to begin with. Instead, use a non-ambiguous date format such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a> - i.e. basically <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> (for the date part).</p>

58066774,2,,58039038,2019-09-23T16:40:49.577,,4,,"<p>The solution I'd use for this one definitely involves a field on the record that contains a comma separated string of all the users who should have access to it. I've worked on the following example to explain better what I have in mind.</p>

<p>I created a model and is called <strong>documents</strong> and looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qeqim.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qeqim.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In a page, I have a table and a button to add new document records. The page looks like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf3c8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf3c8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I click on the <strong>Add Document</strong> button, a dialog pops up and looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzmzs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzmzs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The logic on the <strong>SUBMIT</strong> button on the form above is the following:</p>

<pre><code>widget.datasource.item.owners = app.user.email;
widget.datasource.createItem(function(){
  app.closeDialog();
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will automatically assign the creator of the record the ownership. To add additional owners, I do it on an edit form. The edit form popus up when I click the <strong>edit</strong> button inside the record row. It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5B32.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5B32.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, I'm using a list widget to control who the owners are. For that, it is necessary to use a <code>&lt;List&gt;String</code> custom property in the edit dialog and that will be the datasource of the list widget. In this case, I've called it <strong>owners</strong>. I've applied the following to the <strong>onClick</strong> event of the edit button:</p>

<pre><code>var owners = widget.datasource.item.owners;
owners = owners ? owners.split("","") : [];
app.pageFragments.documentEdit.properties.owners = owners;
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.documentEdit);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>add</strong> button above the list widget has the following logic for the <strong>onClick</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.properties.owners.push("""");
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>TextBox</strong> widget inside the row of the list widget has the following logic for the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.properties.owners[widget.parent.childIndex] = newValue;
</code></pre>

<p>And the <strong>CLOSE</strong> button has the following logic for the <strong>onClick</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>var owners = widget.root.properties.owners || [];
if(owners &amp;&amp; owners.length){
  owners = owners.filter(function(owner){
    return owner != false; //jshint ignore:line
  });
}
widget.datasource.item.owners = owners.join();
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>Since I want to create a logic that will load records only for authorized users, then I had to use a query script in the datasource that will serve that purpose. For that I created this function on a server script:</p>

<pre><code>function getAuthorizedRecords(){
  var authorized = [];
  var userRoles = app.getActiveUserRoles();
  var allRecs = app.models.documents.newQuery().run();
  if(userRoles.indexOf(app.roles.Admins) &gt; -1){
    return allRecs;
  } else {
    for(var r=0; r&lt;allRecs.length; r++){
      var rec = allRecs[r];
      if(rec.owners &amp;&amp; rec.owners.indexOf(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()) &gt; -1){
        authorized.push(rec);
      }
    }
    return authorized;
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the <strong>documents</strong> datasource, I added the following to the query script:</p>

<pre><code>return getAuthorizedRecords();
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaYYA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaYYA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This solution will load all records for admin users, but for non-admin users, it will only load records where their email is located in the <strong>owners</strong> field of the record. This is the most elegant solution I could come up with and I hope it serves your purpose.</p>

  <p><strong>What are the expectations of a Common Data Model data consumer</strong><br>
  In the Common Data Model ecosystem, data consumers are expected to read the metadata and data as the producer described and <strong>not to modify any data</strong> that consumer didn't also produce. If a data consumer wants to extend or modify the data from another data producer, the consumer then becomes a data producer and should follow the best practices of data producers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What are the expectations of a Common Data Model data producer</strong><br>
  In the Common Data Model ecosystem, data producers are expected to provide sufficient information for a data consumer to understand and parse the data files. A general principle is to make the metadata as rich as possible to simplify the experience for data consumers.</p>

  <p>With the Common Data Model, you can put your data into formats that represent concepts and activities that are commonly used and well understood. That way, you can query that data, reuse it, and interoperate with other businesses and apps that use the same format.</p>
  
  <p>Both platforms that currently support the Common Data Model also offer data-integration experiences through Power Query Online that allow users to bring in data from a variety of sources, transform it if necessary, and then map it to standard entities in the Common Data Model or create custom entities. Power Query Online leverages the same visual, self-service data-prep experience as Power Query within Excel and Power BI Desktop, so existing users can ramp up quickly.</p>

Here are the steps I took to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created a calculated SQL model, called it 'Tables', created one
Field of type string and set the name setting of the field to
'Tables_in_MyDatabaseKey'. Set the datasource query to <code>show
tables;</code>. Created a blank page, created a list widget with
datasource set to 'Tables', created a label widget within the list
row and set binding to <code>@datasource.item.Tables_in_MyDatabaseKey</code>.
This resulted in being able to see the correct table name of my
relation table.</li>
<li>Created an other calculated SQL model, called it 'TableDescription',
created one Field of type string and set the name setting of the
field to 'Field'. Set the datasource query to <code>DESCRIBE
MyDBTableName;</code> (This portion has been edited to change DESCRIPTION to DESCRIBE, thank you to @Morfinismo for pointing out this error). Added another list widget to my newly created page
and set the datasource to 'TableDescription', created a label widget
within this list row and set binding to <code>@datasource.item.Field</code>.
This displayed the correct column names within my table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The corrected SQL query is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT

  SUM(IF(DATE_FORMAT(Date,'%m') = '10',Water_Use_Gallons,null)) as 'Oct',

<li>The second <code>With</code> calculates the first <em>Monday</em> of the month, since this is what determines the week number in your scenario. It does that by adding the number of days until the next Monday to the first day of the month, which was calculated in the above step. It also retrieves the week number from your table (in my example I called it 'MyTable', you would replace it with the appropriate name in your scenario)</li>
<li>Finally, given the week number and the first Monday of the month, we can add the appropriate number of days to get the desired result.</li>

<p>EDIT: Adding how to also not render parent components/page</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Controller_Component_Communication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is some in depth documentation on this</a> but put simply you need to add an attribute to your component with the repeat in it so you can pass in the page parent page/components apex controller for example if your parent page had a apex controller with the name <code>MyApexController</code>...</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;apex:attribute name=""controller"" description=""parent page controller"" type=""MyApexController"" assignTo=""{!pageController}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can access its members with public getters and setters from within the component
Heres how that would look
<strong>Parent Page Controller</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class MyApexController {
  public boolean hasAccounts {get; set;}

  public MyApexController(){
    //Your controller constructor
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Child Components Apex controller</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class MyComponentsController {
  public List&lt;Account&gt; accounts {get; set;}
  public MyApexController pageController {get; set;} //this will get set by apex:attibute
  public MyComponentController(){
    if(getAccountsEmpty()){
      this.pageController.hasAccounts = false; //no accounts let parent page know
    } else {
      this.pageController.hasAccounts = true;
    }
  }

public boolean getAccountsEmpty(){
  return this.accounts == null || this.account.size() == 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then on your parent page or component just add a similar attribute to your child component 
Parent page tag
<code>&lt;apex:page rendered=""{!hasAccounts}""&gt;</code> </p>

<p>or a parent component tag</p>

<p><code>&lt;apex:component rendered=""{!hasAccounts}""&gt;</code></p>

<p>There is another table widget under charts, called Table chart, that can be used to present your data in rows and columns. But if you are looking for a property that can achieve this UI effect, then I'm afraid AppMaker does not support this yet.</p>

<p>If you are really keen to make this work, I would suggest that you combine two table widgets that inherit the same data source then wrap them SIDE-BY-SIDE in a horizontal panel. The left side will only contain columns that you want to freeze while the right size will have the rest of the column that can be scrollable. </p>

<p>Make sure to set the height of both tables to auto-grow based on the content (Fit to content). This will give the effect that the two tables are merged when doing vertical scrolling.</p>

widget.datasource.query.sorting.Role._ascending();
widget.datasource.query.sorting.Name._ascending();

<p>which will clear the sorting and reset it to your liking, but will not remove the little arrow graphic on the column heading. For that you will need to navigate back to the page you are already on to refresh it like this:</p>

<pre><code>app.showPage(app.pages.AppRoles);

Ok, so following the example demonstrated on your video link... to populate the input field with some data retrieved form the directory model, put this in the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event of the <strong>UserPicker</strong> widget:</p>

<pre><code>var userData = newValue;
var fullName = userData.FullName;
widget.root.descendants.fullName.value = fullName;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the above code can be shortened by just doing:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.descendants.fullName.value = newValue.FullName;
</code></pre>

<p>I just thought it would be better to explain from where exactly data is coming from. Basically, the <strong>newValue</strong> holds the information of the directory record which contains the <strong>FullName, PrimaryEmail, PrimaryPhone</strong> etc. You will need to look at all the fileds in the directory model to see what is all the information available. Therefore, if you want to fill the input with more than just the Full Name, you can concatenate data like this:</p>

<pre><code>var userData = newValue;
var fullName = userData.FullName;
var email = userData.PrimaryEmail;
var userInfo = fullName + "" - "" + email;
widget.root.descendants.fullName.value = userInfo;
</code></pre>

<p>The important part to understand is that you need to know how to navigate to a widget path in order to populate that widget with a certain value. In this case, I saw that inside your page you have both the <strong>UserPicker</strong> and the <strong>TextBox</strong> widgets and that the <strong>TextBox</strong> widget name is <strong>fullName</strong>; Hence to navigate to the <strong>fullName TextBox</strong> from the <strong>UserPicker</strong> I had to first invoke the <strong>UserPicker</strong> widget which is defined by <strong>widget</strong>. Then access the <strong>root</strong> property which is basically the page in which the widget is located. Then access the <strong>descendants</strong> of the root, which is a list of all the widgets which are direct children of the page. And finally, access the <strong>fullName</strong> inside the descandants list. And that is why the path is:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.descendants.fullName

<li><p>In your 'Query Script' portion enter the following code:</p>

<p>query.filters.Id._in = query.parameters.YourParameter;</p>

<p>departmentsDs.properties.YourParameter = datasource.items.map(function(deptIds) {return deptIds.DeptID;});</p>

<p>departmentDs.load();</p></li>
<li><p>Now go the page that contains your table. If you have not already create a label widget do so now. In this label widget for the text binding enter the following:</p>

<p>@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.loaded &amp;&amp; (@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.items).map(function(Id){return Id.Id}).indexOf(@widget.datasource.item.DeptID) !== -1 ? @datasources.YourDepartmentDs.items[(@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.items).map(function(Id){return Id.Id}).indexOf(@widget.datasource.item.DeptID)].DeptDescription : 'Unable to retrieve Dept Description'</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It is the callback URL that should be given while registering your app with Zoho. This determines where the API server has to redirect the user after completing the authorization flow. The value of this parameter must exactly match with one of the redirect_uri values that is listed for your project in the Zoho's Developer Console.
  Please note that the redirect_uri should be character perfect i.e., the HTTP or HTTPS, case, and trailing slash ('/') of the redirect URLs must all match.</strong> </p>

<p>From a selected list of toppings, the calculated model will be populated and render the sublist of toppings together with an input field for the user to enter the number of desired toppings. </p>

<p>The multi-select widget is bound to a parameter in the datasource.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gV0GU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gV0GU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here is the query function to populate the list onValueChange.</p>

<pre><code>function generateTopingList(query,recordFactory,callback) {
  var toppingList = [];

  if(query.parameters.topingList){
    query.parameters.topingList.forEach(function(e,i){
        var newRecord = recordFactory.create();
        newRecord.Name = e;
        newRecord.Amount = 0;
        toppingList.push(newRecord);
    });
  }

  callback.success(toppingList);
}

<p>With regards to creating your own input widgets, app Maker gives you an option to create re-usable sections in your app through the concept of ""Page Fragments"". You can implement the logic separately, like in my case it's the list widget, then wrap it into a page fragment. You can then use this fragment in your pages. </p>

  <p>we need to create a notifyChange function, which will update the output value of PCF and call the notifyOutputChanged in our PCF component.</p>
  
  <p>We can pass the notifyChange function to our custom React component as part of props.

<p><strong>Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>When configuring the webhook</p>

<ul>
<li>In the webhook URL, do not specify a port</li>
<li>When clicking Save, the service must be up and running and available for calls from Zoho. This is because Zoho immediately makes a test call on clicking save, and rejects storing your changes if the http call doesn't go through. It means that your development or test box needs to be available publicly available. For me, specifying the IP address in the webhook didn't work, I needed a domain name. Not being able to access the developer machine from the Internet, in the end I had to test the integration from a home environment, using a dynamic DNS entry and a router port-forward.</li>
<li>In my case, using the DELETE http verb didn't work. Zoho always appended the full JSON body or just a pair of curly braces to the  call url, making the API call fail. However, Zoho support claims that this approach should work, and this issue doesn't occur in their test environments.</li>
<li>Before calculating the hash, you need to build a string to calculate the hash for. It wasn't clear from their documentation how to do it for JSON payloads (affecting their ""Raw"" and ""Default Payload"" settings). Some unanswered questions on the web asked whether it needed to be deserialized, flattened, ordered. The answer is no, just use the payload as retrieved from the http request. So the correct way to assemble the string is: take URL query arguments (if any) and form fields (if any), sort them by key in alphabetically ascending order, append their key and value strings to the string without quotes, spaces, equal signs. Append the http call content (if any) without any processing to that string.</li>
<li>In hash generation, use UTF8Encoding.</li>
<li>Http headers to use in case of Zoho Default payload and Raw: Content-Type=application/json;charset=UTF-8 and X-Zoho-Webhook-Signature=${Generated Hash Value}. When using x-www-form-urlencoded webhooks: Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded and X-Zoho-Webhook-Signature=${Generated Hash Value}</li>
</ul>

            if (locallyCalculatedHashValue != zohoCalculatedHashValue)
                throw new Exception(""Webhook signature is invalid."");
        }

The client function can be called on the button property called 'onClick'. 
So, on 'onClick' input you should reference the function you'll like to execute: NewProject();</p>

<p><strong>Client Script</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function NewProject() {
  google.script.run
    .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
    console.error(error)
  })
    .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
    console.info(result)
  })
    .CreateFolder();
}

<p>This function is called on the client side and it only calls the server function and returns info about it's execution success or not.</p>

<p><strong>Server Script</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function CreateFolder() {
  var folder = DriveApp.createFolder(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()+' Folder');
  folder.addEditor(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail());
  return(folder.getUrl());

<p>Whenever you create a folder on drive, it's created with the most limited access: only the Drive account owner can access this folder.</p>

<p>So, on the first line this is what we are doing: we are creating a folder named 'Y folder' that is only accessible by the Drive account owner.</p>

<p>The second line <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/folder#addEditor(String)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adds an Editor</a> to that newly created folder, to make it so we only have to put it's mail in between the brackets.</p>

<p>To make this work as you wish the app has to run as Developer's account, this is set up on App Settings, just be aware the app runs on behalf of the Developer account.</p>

<p>Another way to do this instead of using a setter is to use the <code>renderedCallback()</code> lifecycle hook to invoke something like <code>this.template.querySelector('lightning-input.cb').checked = newValue;</code> whenever the template renders/re-renders. However, you will need to ensure the variable tracking the checked state is actually bound to the template somewhere, or else the template may not re-render when the variable is changed.</p>

<p>1.) In the global css, make sure you have the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>.app-Dropdown-Label {
  white-space: normal;
}

.twoLinesLabel{  
  top: -15px !important;
}

.threeLinesLabel{  
  top: -30px !important;
}

.fourLinesLabel{  
  top: -45px !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>2.) On any of the client scripts place the following:</p>

<pre><code>function adjustLabel(widget){
  var label = widget.getElement().children[0];
  var ch = label.clientHeight;
  var lines =  Math.floor(ch / 15);
  switch(lines){
    case 2:
      label.classList.add(""twoLinesLabel"");
      break;
    case 3:
      label.classList.add(""threeLinesLabel"");
      break;
    case 4: 
      label.classList.add(""fourLinesLabel"");
      break;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>3.) On the <strong>onAttach</strong> event handler of any dropdwon you need this adjustment, place the following: </p>

<pre><code>adjustLabel(widget);
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem with that approach is that in the UI you won't be able to see the necessary space your field requires so that it don't overflows with the previous field. So you'll have to preview the app and make adjustements accordingly. </p>

<p>Another way is to make sure that your CSS looks like this instead: </p>

<pre><code>.app-Dropdown-Label {
  white-space: normal;
}

.twoLinesLabel label{  
  top: -15px !important;
}

.threeLinesLabel label{  
  top: -30px !important;
}

.fourLinesLabel label{  
  top: -45px !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then on the <strong>Display</strong> category of the property editor, simply add the correspoding style to the dropdown. That way you will be able to see the changes in the editor immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Filters <strong>startsWith</strong>, <strong>notStartsWith</strong>, <strong>contains</strong>, <strong>notContains</strong> are only supported for strings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, if your field is a string field, it should definitely work. However, the only reason I can think this will not work, is if you are applying a filter on top of another filter without clearing the previous filter first. I.e., If you run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var datasource = widget.datasource;
datasource.query.filters.readByUsers._contains = 'Susanne';
datasource.load();
</code></pre>

<p>It will only return results where the field <strong>readyByUsers</strong> contains the string <code>Sussane</code>. If after that you run the code:</p>

<pre><code>var datasource = widget.datasource;
datasource.query.filters.readByUsers._notContains = 'Susanne';
datasource.load();
</code></pre>

<p>It will return zero results because all the records loaded contain the string <code>Susanne</code>. Hence it might give you that effect that it is not working when indeed is. </p>

<p>To make sure that your filters work properly, you first need to clear the previous filter before applying a new one, unless you explicitly want to apply a second filter on top of the first one. For that, you need to run the <strong>clearFilters</strong> method. So your code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var datasource = widget.datasource;
datasource.query.clearFilters();
datasource.query.filters.readByUsers._contains = 'Susanne';
datasource.load();
</code></pre>

datasource.query.clearFilters();
datasource.query.filters.readByUsers._notContains = 'Susanne';

<p><strong>PowerApps (Canvas app)</strong> is meant for low-code/no-code for quickly building apps by citizen developers, using 200+ connectors for different datasources. Applicable for AAD users, will be available shortly for external users as well. This has per user per app, or unlimited app access kinda licensing models.</p>

<p><strong>PowerApps (Model-driven)</strong> is Dynamics 365 CRM under the hood, with SQL Azure as backend. Strictly for AAD users only. This has module based licensing (Sales, Service, Field Service, Talent, Project mgmt, etc)</p>

<p><strong>PowerApps Portals</strong> (previously Dynamics 365 portals &amp; Adxstudio) - Main purpose is to build portal solutions (B2B or B2C), like website for Employees, Customers, Partners, etc provisioned on top of <strong>Model-driven PowerApps platform</strong>. This can leverage external logins like Google, Facebook, Windows Live (Microsoft), etc. </p>

<p>This has even tricky licensing model - <a href=""https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/portals/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Refer official page</a> and the gist below explains crisply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For external users, Microsoft will differentiate between anonymous and authenticated users. Access by authenticated users will be charged on a ""per log-in"" basis that has raised some confusion among people on Twitter. A log-in is defined as a twenty-four hour period of access by a single authenticated user, and one hundred such log-ins will cost $200 and will be charged on a monthly basis.</p>

59215900,2,,59212588,2019-12-06T15:22:57.287,,0,,"<p>How we do it is we use a function to filter the records using the security roles. For example our function uses </p>

<pre><code>var user = convertName(app.user.username);
var role = app.user.role;
var ds = app.datasources.DashFilters;
ds.query.clearFilters();
if (!guestBoolean){
  if (role.User || role.Admins){
    ds.query.filters.Roles.name._equals = user;
    ds.query.filters.event_status._notContains = 'Pending';
    ds.query.filters.event_status._notEquals = 'Closed';
  }
  if (role.QADirector){
    ds.query.filters.event_status._notContains = 'Pending';
  }
  }
  if (guestBoolean){
    ds.query.filters.event_status._notContains = 'Pending';
  }
  ds.load();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The main difference with my function is we have related roles for each record in the data model and that can vary so we check for the current user being a role related to a record. That part is the <code>!guestBoolean</code>. The <code>role.Admins</code> and <code>role.QADirector</code> are using the built in security roles we have assigned to our app.</p>

<p>So in short, query the records using a function which looks for the current logged in user and filter based on your criteria from there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's great to hear your up and working again!  We are aware of this issue and are working through a longer term fix.  The specific bug appears to be related to some changes made in the Google Cloud session policy control that may have rolled out to your domain recently interacting with AppMaker in a way that was not expected.  We've spent time diagnosing the underlying issue and we beleive we know the root cause.  I suspect your domain admin did a version of the workaround below.</p>
  
  <p>Without getting too far into the details, the specific bug is that for a Deployer of an AppMaker application, if the Google Cloud Session policy is set with any expiration time, the returned token AppMaker sees is invalid, triggering a loop in AppMaker trying to generate a valid security token.  Historically, these session tokens never expired but recently there was  beta feature launch that allowed domain admins to set them to expire.  We strongly suspect your domain recently set this expiration policy explicitly and that's what is causing the bug.</p>
  
  <p>The good news is that these policies are overridable per Organizational Unit and we have tested that OUs which have the original classic Never Expire setting do, in fact, allow AppMaker to work.</p>
  
  <p>My suspicion is that your domain admin has reverted recent, local changes to your organizational policy under the admin.google.com console, specifically under Security > Google Cloud session control (Beta).</p>
  
  <p>If this happens again, here the workaround we would recommend.  Note you don't need to do this if you're currently up and working. You will need the help of someone with admin.gogole.com powers, specifically User and Organizational Unit powers at your organization. It is a slight increase in security risk but it restores some classic behavior that was standard until recently.</p>
  
  <p>The summary of the workaround is to override the Google Cloud session control expiration setting such that individuals who need access to AppMaker deployments can have it.  To mitigate systemic security risk, this is best done by creating a limited purpose Organizational Unit with just that setting different than the parent OU settings.</p>
  
  <p>The workaround is to:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Contact someone in your domain with Admin powers for your Google for Business license.</li>
  <li>Have your admin proceed to <a href=""https://admin.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://admin.google.com</a>.  The actions below need to be performed by a domain admin.</li>
  <li>Under the Users section, identify the specific user account that needs the ability to deploy AppMaker Apps.</li>
  <li>Identify the Organizational Unit of that Appmaker dev user and make a note of it.</li>
  <li>Under the Organization Units settings, locate the Organization Unit you identified above.</li>
  <li>Create a new Organization Unit underneath that user's current Organizational Unit with some descriptive identifying it as special w.r.t AppMaker. So for Developers, make something like DevelopersWhoAreAlsoAppMakerDevs.</li>
  <li>Back under the Users tab, locate the user from step 3.  Move this user into the new Organizational Unit you've just created. This change can take a while to propagate.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>-Interlude- At this point, you've made a new Organizational Unit for just that individual and added them to it.  You can certainly add multiple people to that OU, especially if they're already in the same parent OU.  Use your discretion as to what amount of Organizational rework you wish to pursue.  You may not be using OUs at all or you may decide to just turn off this control for the whole domain. It's up to you.</p>
  
  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>Under admin.google.com's Security settings, locate the Google Cloud session control (beta) settings.</li>
  <li>Under this panel, from the dropdown menu on the left, locate the Organization Unit you just created.</li>
  <li>Be sure to select ONLY the OU you intend to change.</li>
  <li>Change the ""Google Cloud Console and Google Cloud SDK session control"" from expiring to ""Session Never Expires"".</li>
  <li>Save your changes.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The account you selected in step 3 should now be able to deploy AppMaker apps.</p>
  
  <p>It appears this OU change is only necessary for the deployer of an AppMaker app, not an individual user.  Note also that if you have multiple AppMaker developers who all have different current OU settings, you may need to create multiple daughter OUs to avoid a sudden radical shift in OU settings for an individual account.</p>

You can create a table for authors, and a table for books. Each author you add to the list will have a name, surname, email, etc, and an unique <strong>Author ID</strong>.<br>
Now you want to add a book for that author.

app.datasources.MYDATASOURCEONE.load();
app.datasources.MYDATASOURCETWO.load(function(){

<pre><code>/* Changes the slider color when the value is false*/
.customCheckbox&gt;input:not(checked){

}

/* Changes the slider color when the value is true */
.customCheckbox&gt;input:checked{
  background-color: blue

/* Changes the slider round button color when the value is false */
.customCheckbox&gt;label:after{
  background-color: orange;
}

/* Changes the slider round button color when the value is true */
.customCheckbox&gt;input:checked+label:after{

You can sort it when doing something with the fields using <em>Sort()</em> or <em>SortByColumn()</em> functions.

<code>ClearCollect(CollectionSorted; SortByColumns(CollectionNotSorted; ""Order""))</code><br>

<pre><code>If(

<p>I don't think there's no clear answer, you'll have to experiment. Especially that you tagged ""migration tool"" (so old-school, battle-tested but lower priority Metadata API; seems that all focus is now on SFDX style of deployments). Do you use any version control (ideally Git) or do you hope to somehow compare source &amp; target org, figure out the deltas and deploy only them?</p>

<p>Remember that often SF gets better at detecting ""no changes"" with every release (how old is your migration tool's jar file?). For example when I deploy my current project to an empty sandbox (exact copy of prod, no custom objects, code etc yet) the initial deploy takes ~7 minutes. But any subsequent deploy with same content or slight changes takes just 3-4. So try to calculate time lost in the grand scheme of things and decide what gains you want to see / how much time you want to spend on experimenting and tweaking the solution.</p>

<p>You could look into <strong>dedicated deployment solutions</strong> such as <strong>Gearset, Autorabit, Odaseva</strong> (I'm not affiliated with either and this list is not exhaustive). They often are capable of running a comparison for you.</p>

<p>There are several <strong>projects that try to compose package.xml</strong> based on Git diff(erence) between two commits. Of course you need to have a repo first and some regime:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/cloudsandbox/sfdx-gen-pack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/cloudsandbox/sfdx-gen-pack</a> saw presentation about it at Cloudforce London 2019</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit</a> seems to have a ""diff"" command (disclaimer: I used to work for Accenture but not affiliated now, haven't worked on the tool, haven't used it personally)</li>
<li><a href=""https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a> this seems to be interesting and mature. Built by SF employees, not an official tool but used to CI deploy the non-profit packages they build (maybe you heard about Non Profit Starter Pack, especially if you ever considered enabling Person Accounts). I'm not sure if they do delta deployments as such but there seems to be a command that updates package.xml with files in repository so it's a start? <a href=""https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#part-4-running-tasks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#part-4-running-tasks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not saying CumulusCI will be a silver bullet but out of these 3 seems to be most actively maintained ;) But sounds like you'd have to get familiar with SFDX (if not whole thing then at least commands to <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_mdapi.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">convert</a> the project back and forth between ""source"" (SFDX) structure and Metadata API structure</p>

However, Flow Bot is a general bot, and doesn't have a way to route the response back to your individual Flow, and specifically to the instance of the Flow. Thankfully, this is changing - see <a href=""https://poszytek.eu/en/microsoft-en/office-365-en/powerautomate-en/register-response-from-custom-adaptive-cards-sent-from-power-automate-to-teams/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for information. It's not clear from the post whether it will handle the ""Bot-to-user"" scenario in version 1 though, which I see you use in your solution, and also, as stated in the blog, it's only expected in Feb. So, it would seem there are two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wait till Feb for the new feature</li>
<li>Create your own Bot to send the cards from, and handle the responses - there are a few small tricky parts here as you need to send the initial message on a schedule, so you'd be using something called ""pro-active messaging"", but it's not too complex and something there's good guidance on here in Stack Overflow (I've myself answered a few questions recently on it so can help more if you go this route)</li>

<p><code>Trigger.newMap.keySet()</code> is a <code>Set&lt;Id&gt;</code>. Unless the Name field of the <code>NewMember__c</code> object contains an Account Id, this query will return no data.</p>

<pre><code>    {
        if(Mapnewmemberstoaccounts.containsKey(objNewMember.Name)!= null)

<p>You never populate the variable <code>Mapnewmemberstoaccounts</code>, so checking it here will not achieve anything. The method <code>containsKey()</code> returns a Boolean. It will never return a <code>null</code> value.</p>

<p>Your code should not throw a <code>CalloutException</code> for an error that has nothing to do with a callout. If you wish to stop a specific record from being committed to the database, use the <code>addError()</code> method on that record alone. Throwing an exception will result in rolling back the entire transaction.</p>

<pre><code>        }

<p>Both arms of this <code>if</code> statement are coded to throw an exception. That does not make sense; the result will be that (if the enclosing <code>for</code> loop ever executes) you cannot insert any Accounts because your trigger always throws an exception.</p>

<p>In rough outline, your trigger should follow a logical path like this:</p>

<pre><code>Create a collection variable
for each Account in the trigger set:
    if the Account's record type is ""New Member"":
        Add the Account's identifier to the set.

Query New Member records matching the Account identifiers.
Build a Map between Identifiers and New Member records.

for each Account in the trigger set:
    if the Account's record type is ""New Member"":
        Check if the Account's Identifier is in the New Member collection
        If it is, call addError() for this Account

<p>as you are trying to access image using <code>Design property</code> you can use below Lightning code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;aura:component implements=""forceCommunity:availableForAllPageTypes"" access=""global""&gt;
    &lt;aura:attribute name=""showBannerImage"" type=""boolean"" default="""" access=""global""/&gt;

            &lt;img src=""{!'/sfsites/c/resource/'+v.bannerImage}"" style=""width: 100%;"" /&gt;
        &lt;/aura:if&gt;
    &lt;/div
&lt;/aura:component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and your Lightning Design Will look same</p>

<pre><code>&lt;design:component&gt;
    &lt;design:attribute name=""showBannerImage"" label=""Show Banner Image"" /&gt;
    &lt;design:attribute name=""bannerImage"" label=""Banner Image"" /&gt;
&lt;/design:component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you just have to call your Static Resource Name in <code>showBannerImage</code> property. for example if your static resource name is <code>imageResource</code> then you just have to call this name simply in <code>community lightning page attribute.</code></p>

<p>The only difference was that I added a batch size of 10.  It [nevertheless] returns the correct number of rows in the database...</p>

<p>I got the [original] code working as well, by similarly changing the batch size to a smaller number [rather than -1 to retrieve all records].  It turns out that retrieving <em>all</em> records is not necessary to get a correct value for this totalCount field:</p>

<pre><code>local!countOfRows: a!queryEntity(
    entity: cons!MY_DATABASE_TABLE_DS,
    query: a!query(
      pagingInfo: a!pagingInfo(

        batchSize: 0
      )
    ),
    fetchTotalCount: true
  ).totalCount,   
</code></pre>

<p>In actual fact, setting the batchsize to 0 [for this application] is the best option since this gets the metadata (including the totalCount) without actually wasting any processing time retrieving the rows of data (which aren't used in this instance) - thereby increasing the performance (Thanks Mike Schmitt for the tip on this one).</p>

I do have to say that the initial choice for AM was largely due to the fact that it was part of our G Suite subscription and I was somewhat familiar with Google Apps Script and HTML/CSS due to some free standing app development using the HtmlService. Given that my background and education is actually not programming related at all I would consider myself to be the target market for these types of programs were little to no code is required.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the reality is that my place of work never really committed much funding to this project outside of my time and more so this was probably what some coders would apparently refer to as their 20% project.

<p>If you decided to use PCF as your component instead of web resource, better know the limitations. PCF control can be rendered either as a field control or dataset control which means you are going to replace the textbox or subgrid into something else for visualization.</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Documentation</a> says:</p>

<p>Got this to work, but it was a bit finicky. The catch seemed to be giving the List a value-pairing table, instead of just a list of values.
First I collected the Option Sets from CDS, and added a column to indicate the source name, for reference. This could easily be combined into a single collection, and then filtered later but I was thinking simple.</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(colOptionSet1,AddColumns(Choices('Ownership (Accounts)'),""appSource"",""Ownership"")); 
ClearCollect(colOptionSet2,AddColumns(Choices('Preferred Method of Contact (Accounts)'),""appSource"",""Preferred Method""));

Then added a List control with Items equal to</p>

<p>You may need to use the right-side property pane to toggle between Value and ""appSource"" (from collections above), but this did allow me to toggle between two separate Option Set fields in a single list.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>app.use(bodyParser.json());
</code></pre>

<p>This parser will add the <strong>parsed</strong> (object) content of a request's body to the <code>body</code> property of the first <code>req</code> parameter of your route handler <code>(req, res) =&gt; { ... }</code>.</p>

<p>The hash of your webhook, however, is calculated based on the <strong>raw</strong> (string) payload. While you could use <code>JSON.stringify</code> to convert your parsed body back to a string, this may result in inconsistencies with the original raw payload.</p>

<p>For example, if your currency is <code>Euro</code>, Zoho will pass the encoded <code>""\u20a""</code> as the value for <code>currency_symbol</code>. However, if you use <code>JSON.stringify</code> to convert your parsed body back to a string, you'll find that it produces the unencoded <code>""‚Ç¨""</code> instead. And because this results in both strings not being identical, they will not produce the same hash.</p>

<p>Without direct access to the raw body, it is very difficult to detect precisely what's the difference between the original raw body &amp; the result of your <code>JSON.stringify</code> and thus how the latter should be transformed for it to be in the same format as the original raw body. The simplest way to overcome this, is to use the <code>verify</code> method of your parser, to add the raw body to eg. the <code>rawBody</code> property of the first <code>req</code> parameter of your route handler, as described <a href=""https://flaviocopes.com/express-get-raw-body/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this article</a> :</p>

<p>What happens if you try to click the link in the line with error. It should take you to page where you can see JavaScript code. If it fails on such click - it'll also fail when requested from script.</p>

<p>Post more code, what's in ""D3"" variable. I suspect your zip file uploaded as static resource doesn't have just 3 files free-floating. They probably got zipped with the folder in which you had them so now either you repackage it or you build your path like <code>D3 + '/somefolder/d3.v3.min.js'</code>. Or maybe there's a typo in the filename.</p>

<p>Either way - click the link in the URL and keep experimenting in address bar until you manage to see the file, then adjust your code (or zip). Is it only the JS file that fails or CSS too?</p>

<p>Most likely, this means that further up your call stack, some code is calling an asynchronous and then blocking on the task it returns (using <code>.Result</code>, <code>.Wait()</code>, or <code>.GetAwaiter().GetResult()</code>).

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I think there is some kind of extra method that needs to be called on the <code>.sorting</code> property, but I can't find out what it is called. Maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>dataset.sorting.setSorting({name: 'createdon', sortDirection: 1});
</code></pre>

<p>I think you're going to have to try a bunch of likely method names and see what works.</p>

<p><strong>Background and links:</strong></p>

<p>The only <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/sample-controls/data-set-component-canvas#dataset-api-methods-that-arent-supported-in-canvas-apps-public-preview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference I could find to <code>dataset.sorting</code> was from here:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this preview for canvas apps, only a limited set of filtering and sortStatus methods are supported. Filter and sort can be applied to dataset on primary type columns except for the GUID. Filter and sorting can be applied in the same way as in model-driven apps.To retrieve the dataset with filtering and sorting information, call
  the methods in <code>context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].filtering</code>
  and <code>context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].sorting</code>, then invoke
  the <code>context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].refresh()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that the <code>.filtering</code> and <code>.sorting</code> properties are handled similarly, and that there are some methods attached to them, and only some are supported. That is about as vague as they could make it...</p>

<p><a href=""https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Apps-Component-Framework/How-to-use-filter-and-search-in-PCF-for-React/m-p/388748"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I did find an example of how <code>.filtering</code> is used:</a></p>

<pre><code>    _context.parameters.sampleDataset.filtering.setFilter({
      conditions: conditionArray,

    });
</code></pre>

<p>There is a brief <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/reference/filtering/setfilter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference to <code>.setFilter()</code> in the docs</a>, as well as <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/reference/filterexpression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>FilterExpression</code></a></p>

<p>There is a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/reference/sortstatus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SortStatus</code> reference</a>, but it doesn't have any corresponding methods explicitly called out. It is possible that this is not yet a supported feature in the public preview, or the documentation is lacking and the name and syntax of the method you need to call on <code>.sorting</code> is not yet documented.</p>

<p>Salesforce orgs other than scratch orgs don't provide source tracking at present. To identify user changes, you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempt to extract all metadata and diff it against your version control, which is considerably harder than it sounds and is implemented by a variety of commercial DevOps tools for Salesforce (GearSet, Copado, etc).</li>
<li>Have the user manually add components to a Change Set or Unmanaged Package, and use a Metadata API client as above to retrieve the contents of that package. (Little-known fact, a Change Set can be retrieved as a package!)</li>
</ul>

<p>To emphasize: DevOps on Salesforce <em>does not work like other platforms</em>. Working on the Metadata API requires a fair amount of time investment and specialization. Harness the existing work of the Salesforce community where you can, but be aware that the task you are laying out may be rather more involved than you think and it's not necessarily something you can just throw together from off-the-shelf components.</p>

<p>Query string parameters are secured over <code>https</code>.  Its a common misconception, where people think whole url is open in plain text in transmission. When a request is made to an <code>https</code> url, first it establishes a Secure Tunnel to <code>[instance-url].my.salesforce.com</code> then transmits the rest of the url and any other data over the secure tunnel.</p>

<p>If you're worried about some man in the middle attack sniffing out the SSN from your query string, don't. One downside is, if you are accessing this url from a browser instead of a programmatic call, then there is a chance for browser to stored/cache for history or auto complete, then it won't be so good.</p>

<p>But I doubt if you would be able to do this via browser, as salesforce requires a bearer token set in Authorization header and there is no easy way that I know of to set headers while typing the url in the browser or clicking a link.</p>

<ol>
<li>Server's JSON-encoded response contains no <code>message</code> property, hence <code>Logger.log(result.message);</code> logs <code>undefined</code>. (Maybe trying logging <code>response.getContentText()</code> to see what properties are available in your case -- or refer to the API documentation.)</li>
<li><code>Authorization</code> and <code>orgId</code> headers are missing in the request you send. (Looks like authtokens are deprecated (<a href=""https://desk.zoho.com/DeskAPIDocument#Authentication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://desk.zoho.com/DeskAPIDocument#Authentication</a>) and you instead need to use OAuth 2.0 (<a href=""https://desk.zoho.com/DeskAPIDocument#OauthTokens)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://desk.zoho.com/DeskAPIDocument#OauthTokens)</a>.)</li>
<li>Data needs to be sent in request's body. (You appear to be sending it in the query string.)</li>
<li>I've not read the documentation in detail but I don't see any mention of query string parameters <code>authtoken</code> and <code>JSONString</code> (CTRL+F returns no matches). So you might want to get rid of them in your code and instead follow what the documentation says.</li>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_search_parameterized.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Parameterized Search API</a>. This option is available out of the box with POST as the method. The API is a RESTful interface to Salesforce's text-based search engine. Normally, text-based search uses SOSL as the query language. Parameterized Search API skips SOSL and gives you an easier option to work with.</li>
</ol>

      }
   ],
   ""fields"": [""id""]

    ""Id"" : ""003...""
  } ]

</code></pre>

<p>The value of <code>q</code> key in the JSON payload must be the same as the value in the <code>where</code> key/clause. You're doing a full-text search on <code>123456789</code> across all objects and all fields in the search index. This could return many records..but you're filtering the search down in a structured way to guarantee that you'll only see <code>Contact</code> records where <code>SSN__c = '123456789'</code>. As long as the objects + fields you're trying to retrieve are present in the index the results you'll see via Parameterized Search in this specific example are going to be the same as that of a SOQL query via <code>/query</code></p>

<p>For the first option, if you know all the fields that the 'PowerAppsStyling' object will have, then you can at the beginning of your app (e.g., on the App.OnStart logic) read the values from your settings SP list and create the object, so that you can use it throughout the app, something along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(localStylesTemp, PowerAppsStyling); // To make only 1 network call to the SP list
Set(
    LocalStyles,
    {

<p>Here are some steps that you could perform to achieve that - the steps are from @clavinfernandes <a href=""https://clavinfernandes.wordpress.com/2019/11/01/soap-custom-connectors-in-microsoft-flow/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to his blog post</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Get Postman</li>
<li>Create a collection in Postman</li>
<li>Configu Postman to use your SOAP endpoint</li>
<li>Save the request - test it</li>
<li>Export the collection (Collection V1) - that will be a json file</li>
</ol>

<p>When done you can create the Custom Connector from the Power Automate page:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Power Automate site</li>
<li>Under Data, choose Custom connectors</li>
<li><ul>
<li>New Custom connector -> Import a postman collection (V1)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review the info from your exported collection and fill in the general information popup</li>
<li>Configure the Authentication type and then review the definitions</li>
<li>Then click Create connector</li>
</ol>

<p>You should be able to use that within your flows now:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new flow and choose a trigger (Power Apps trigger in your case I believe)</li>
<li>Add you connector and configure it with the correct properties</li>
<li>You can use a combination of the Compose action with the Xpath expression to get information from the XML that is returned by your call.</li>
<li>Use the ""Respond to a PowerApp or flow"" action to pass the information back to your App</li>

<p>All of these examples are in json but they should be easily translatable to csv and xml respectively.</p>

<p>Deleting from the Event object requires a job, as with all operations, and the example job request that I have been using and sent to <code>&lt;your salesforce site&gt;/services/async/48.0/job/</code> looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""operation"": ""delete"",
    ""object"": ""Event"",
    ""concurrencyMode"": ""Parallel"",
    ""contentType"": ""JSON""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The server then replies with something along the lines of (some items omitted for brevity)</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""apexProcessingTime"": 0,
    ""apiActiveProcessingTime"": 0,
    ""apiVersion"": 48.0,
    ""assignmentRuleId"": null,
    ""concurrencyMode"": ""Parallel"",
    ""contentType"": ""JSON"",
    ...
    ""numberRetries"": 0,
    ""object"": ""Event"",
    ""operation"": ""delete"",
    ""state"": ""Open"",
    ""systemModstamp"": ""2020-04-08T15:13:42.000+0000"",
    ""totalProcessingTime"": 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then create batches as per norm at <code>&lt;your salesforce&gt;/services/async/48.0/job/&lt;jobId&gt;/batch/</code> except delete batches can only contain Ids for the items you want to delete, for instance <code>[{""Id"":""00U5I00000145XcUAI""},{""Id"":""00U5I00000145XdUAI""},{""Id"":""00U5I00000145XeUAI""},{""Id"":""00U5I00000145XgUAI""},{""Id"":""00U5I00000145XhUAI""}]</code>.</p>

<p>After the batch completes and either fails or completes successfully, you can retrieve your results by sending the usual requests to get your result ids and then the results from those result ids. I didn't do anything different from a query operation on the Bulk API.</p>

<p>In my case, the server responded with</p>

<pre><code>[ {
  ""success"" : true,
  ""created"" : false,
  ""id"" : ""00U5I00000145XcUAI"",
  ""errors"" : [ ]
}, {
  ""success"" : true,
  ""created"" : false,
  ""id"" : ""00U5I00000145XdUAI"",
  ""errors"" : [ ]
}, {
  ""success"" : true,
  ""created"" : false,
  ""id"" : ""00U5I00000145XeUAI"",
  ""errors"" : [ ]
}, {
  ""success"" : true,
  ""created"" : false,
  ""id"" : ""00U5I00000145XgUAI"",
  ""errors"" : [ ]
}, {
  ""success"" : true,
  ""created"" : false,
  ""id"" : ""00U5I00000145XhUAI"",
  ""errors"" : [ ]
} ]

<p>When I'd set the isLoading attribute of the DataTable element, it would show the spinner somewhere within all of the divs DataTable creates. But the height of the spinner was bigger than the height of the datatable element used in internal calculation whether to trigger the loadMore callback function, so it trips it off again and again...</p>

<p>The way it stopped the infinite loop for me was to keep the isLoading on false at all times. You can implement your own spinner as an overlay over the whole table which won't initiate height recalculation.</p>

<p>Again, this solution is specific to when the table shows only a few elements, so the spinner image is larger than the table. If you use a modal window or some other container, try setting the height explicitly as suggested by Andrii:</p>

<p><code>Attachment</code> and <code>Document</code> objects have exactly same API names, you can view their definitions in <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_attachment.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOAP API definition</a> or in REST API explorer (there was something which you can still see in screenshot in <a href=""https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/292654/using-salesforce-api-explorer-for-documenting-apex-rest-services"">here</a>, seems to be down now, maybe they're moving it to another area in documentation...)</p>

<p>The Files (incl. ""Chatter Files"") are stored in <code>ContentDocument</code> and <code>ContentVersion</code> object. The name is unexpected because long time ago SF purchased another company's product and it was called ""Salesforce Content"". In beginning it was bit of mess, now it's better integrated into whole platform but still some things lurk like File folders can be called Libraries sometimes in documentation but actual API name is <code>ContentWorkspace</code>. The entity relationship diagram can help a bit: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm</a></p>

<p><code>ContentDocument</code> is a header to which many places in SF link (imagine file wasting space on disk only once but being cross-linked from multiple records). It can have at least 1 version and if you need to update the document - you'd upload new version but all links in org wouldn't change, they'd still link to header.</p>

<p>So, how to use it? </p>

<ul>
<li>REST API guide: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_insert_update_blob.htm</a></li>
<li>or maybe Chatter API guide (you tagged it with chatter so chances are you already use it): <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_files.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.chatterapi.meta/chatterapi/connect_resources_files.htm</a></li>
<li>some of my answers here might help (shameless plug). They're about upload and reading data too and one is even about data loader... but you might experiment with exporting files first, get familiar with structure before you load?

</blockquote>

<p><code>choco install sfdx-cli --ignore-checksums</code> should work OK.</p>

<p>Next error you might get will be about typos in the install script (author of choco package didn't escape spaces properly and it dies on ""C:\Program Files"", at least on my machine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'C:\Program' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file. ERROR: Running [""cmd"" /C ""C:\Program

  '1'. See log for possible error</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can have a look at what's in the install script, failed installations typically are copied to ""lib-bad"": <code>C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib-bad\sfdx-cli\tools</code></p>

<p>I'm not a PowerShell guru but by the look of it it just tries to run <code>sfdx update</code> at the end of installation. I can skip the script and run it manually.</p>

<p><code>choco install sfdx-cli --ignore-checksums -n</code> works OK
and then close the console (to reload the PATH variables). Open new console and 
<code>sfdx update</code> will work too.</p>

<p>In Power Automate, it's not as simple, but I've found one alternative at <a href=""https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Flows/How-can-you-enter-a-Newline-into-a-string/td-p/102447"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this community post</a> where you can use the expression below to have a new line character:</p>

<pre><code>json('{""NL"":""\n""}')?['NL']
</code></pre>

<p>So if you have your variables initialized as below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSJi7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SSJi7.png"" alt=""Power Automate - variable initialization""></a></p>

<p>You can append the new line inside an Apply to each block:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAC9M.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YAC9M.png"" alt=""Appending new line to each item in the array""></a></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<ol>
<li>What defines 'the first file'? In your second (duplicate) query you don't seem to apply any ordering, so Salesforce might return you the same records in different order based on their database structuring. In your first sub-select query there is.</li>
<li>Is there a specific reason you use if, if, if, instead of if, else if, else if? With this approach you prevent the second and third item to run, even when the first one applied. This will simplify your code as you don't need all duplicate check (i == 0, i > 0 and such)</li>
<li>How is it possible that a different Salesforce record (File vs. ebMobile__File__c) can have the same Salesforce ID? (in your query for listMembers)</li>
</ol>

<p>Couple suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Only query the records you really want to delete using Offset (shift starting record)</li>
<li>Please try to avoid doing queries and DML actions in loops, since this is bad for performance, but also might cause running into governor limits</li>
<li>Apply usage of variableBinding, this will ensure no SOQL Injection can be applied (when the account IDs are e.g. fetched from the front-end)</li>
<li>Simplify your logic to do what you really want; if you query only those to delete (see 1.) then you can simply loop ones to determine the Signature condition and then just delete the list of Files per Account. In my perspective, there is no need to query the files again, since you already have their IDs and records, so you can simply specify to delete the retrieved records, right?</li>

<p>(I've already answered that for you, didn't I? :))</p>

<p>So the only difference would be that you want to set <code>OwnerId</code>, possibly also <code>CreatedById</code> as that user. You can set Owner always as long as the owner is an active user. ""Created By"", ""Last Modified By"" are audit fields, normally not editable. If the owner is inactive or you really want to set ""Created By"" - you can. But you have only 1 shot at this, audit fields can be set only on insert. After that every update is managed by SF.

<hr>

<p>Now... this isn't always needed. OK, you will recreate the file but all links to it (from other records, from chatter posts, libraries) will be lost. It's in <code>ContentDOcumentLink</code> and if you delete the document - they cascade delete. You might not have info or permissions to recreate all the links.</p>

<p>Your first line of defense could be checking whether file can be restored from Recycle Bin. It can't be done in pure REST API but you could use SF SOAP API or write an Apex service that would try to do that for you.

On client side it'll be a JSON object with right field names, like you already have <code>{ lstConIds : this.selectedRecords, invoiceId : this.invId}</code>. On Apex side it can be a function with multiple arguments or just 1 argument (some helper wrapper class, again with right field names). Salesforce will ""unpack"" that JSON for you and put into right fields before your code is called.</p>

<p>Your preference which would be cleaner. I tend to use wrappers. If you have a reusable service-like function and you want to add some optional parameters later - you'd simply put new field in wrapper class and job done. Might be not as easy to add a new parameter to function used in other apex code, bit messier.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method does not seem to work for VERY large Sharepoint lists (over 100k records).</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a <code>DEV</code> Sharepoint list and a <code>DEV</code> PowerApps environment and begin all of your PowerApps developent against this list. 

<ul>
<li>When it is in a good place (all columns added, all the bugs worked out), use a copy of this list to create a <code>PROD</code> Sharepoint list.</li>
<li>Create a <code>PROD</code> PowerApps environment as well; copy your <code>DEV</code> PowerApp to the new environment.</li>
<li>Repeat for a <code>QA</code> list and app if you like</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Within your app, add a Radio button with Items property set to <code>[""DEV"", ""QA"", ""PROD""]</code></li>
<li>For the PowerApp within the <code>DEV</code> env, set the Default property of the radio button to ""DEV"". Repeat for the other env's respectively. 

<ul>
<li>Its important to set this Default property EVERY TIME you push the app into the next environent.</li>
<li>Maybe someday PowerApps will expose the Environment as an app property and you can set this programmatically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Here's the special sauce) For all of your logic where you ClearCollect, Filter, Patch, LookUp, etc. (anywhere you call a Sharepoint datasource), use an IF statement to control which Sharepoint list the app looks at. 
4a. Set the radio button's <code>OnSelect</code> property to <code>Set(varEnv, rdoEnv.Selected.Value)</code>
4b. For all code which use a Sharepoint list write your code with the IF statement. Something like:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Filter(
  If(
    varEnv = ""DEV"", MY_DEV_LIST,
    varEnv = ""QA"", MY_QA_LIST,
    varEnv = ""PROD"", MY_PROD_LIST
  ),
  someValue = anotherValue
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Works like a charm AS LONG AS:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The columns in your lists are exactly the same</li>
<li>If you use this with a Form controls DataSource property, you'll need to set it to ONE of the lists when you add/remove fields. 

<ul>
<li>After a field is added/removed, you can revert the DataSource property to the If statement.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

  <p>It is possible to integrate powerapps inside a Task for AzureDevops?</p>

<p><strong>Yes it is.</strong> 
You can leverage the <em>Solution</em> concept of the Microsoft Power Platform and the <a href=""https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerApps-BuildTools"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Power Apps BuildTools</a> extension for Azure DevOps.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> </p>

<p>With this build tool, you can automatically check-in a Solution into source control and deploy it using a continuous delivery approach with the help of Azure DevOps. See the screenshot for a sample configuration of the Export and Import Solution Task.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2cU9D.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2cU9D.png"" alt=""Power Apps Export BuildTools Task in Azure DevOps""></a></p>

<li>Power Automate Flows</li>
<li>AI Builder Models</li>
<li>Common Data Service Entities</li>

61648046,2,,61647756,2020-05-07T00:59:55.243,,0,,"<p>We aim to extract information from SF via its REST API in order to generate a report in Word format. To to so we need to run queries into the SF custom objects that contain the relevant information. Typically, we are looking to get this information from a collection of custom objects.</p>

<p>One of the custom fields contains an RTF field which contain links to the relevant images. These images are displayed when the objects are viewed in the SF UI. 
There are several entries in both StackOverflow and Salesforce:StackExchange regarding this topic. Many of these entries discuss Apex methods. The ones that discuss retrieving the images via the REST API did not allow me to be successful.</p>

<p>An entry in the SF REST API developer guide <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_sobject_rich_text_image_retrieve.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> instructs us how to achieve this: 
send a request to the REST API via a GET as follows:</p>

<pre><code> /vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/id/richTextImageFields/fieldName/contentReferenceId 
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is to determine what is the SObjectName, the id, the fieldName and the contentReferenceId.
We can get the names from the SF database schema we are working with. Fortunately, we can get the IDs from the embedded links in the RTF field.</p>

<p><strong>IDs</strong></p>

<p>The embedded links in the RTF field take the following form:</p>

<pre><code>https://[someInternalSalesforceURL].force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0Y3l00000G31DT&amp;feoid=00N1N00000F14uz&amp;refid=0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p>There are three IDs in this link:</p>

<ul>
<li>eid: entity ID</li>
<li>feoid: field entity ID</li>
<li>refid: contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to use the eid and the refid to contruct the request to the SF REST API as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>id = eid</li>
<li>contentReferenceId = contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example above:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/fieldName/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Names</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to review your database schema and work out the SObjectName and the fieldName. The SObjectName is the Name of the custom object that contains the RTF field. Say: myObject__c
The fieldName obviously is the name of the RTF field: say myRTFfield__c
The request to SF then works out to be:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/myObject__c/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/myRTFfield__c/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Retrieving the image</strong></p>

<p>Before sending this to SF you need to prefix it with your salesforce instance URL and you need to articulate the REST API version, e.g. v48.0</p>

<p>Sending this as a GET to SF, I am an R user, returns an object that contains the image as data (in the R case: a matrix). This data object can be converted to an image and saved as a PNG file.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You are are authorised by the SF API and received an access token or SessionID and an instance_url.</li>
<li>You have code that sends a query to SF which returns the object with the relevant RTF field.</li>
<li>you have retrieved the embedded link(s) from the RTF field and peeled the eid and refid from the link.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample R code</strong></p>

<p>In R this looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>library(httr)
library(png)
request_headers &lt;- c(""Accept"" = ""application/json"", 
                     ""Content-Type"" = ""application/json"",
                     ""Authorization"" = paste0(""Bearer "", access_token))
url &lt;- ""/services/data/v48.0/sobjects/myObject__c/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/myRTFfield__c/0EM3l0000039EK0""

First, you want to make sure SQL can do a simple comparison when selecting rows, so you'll start by calculating a string to match your date on since your [Date] field is a string not a date.</p>

<p>Second, calculate the minutes in your shift (either 540 for a full shift or scaled down to 0 at 7 AM exactly) ahead of time so you aren't calculating minutes in each row.</p>

<p>Third, when summing for operators, use a simple sum on the minutes and calculate efficiency from that sum and your pre-calculated shift so far minutes.</p>

<p>One note - I'm casting the minutes-so-far as FLOAT in my example, maybe not the best type but it's clearer than other decimal types like DECIMAL(18,6) or whatever. Pick something that will show the scale you want.</p>

<p>My example uses a Common Table Expression to generate that date string and minutes-so-far FLOAT, that's nice because it fits in a direct query, view, function, or stored procedure, but you could DECLARE variables instead if you wanted to. </p>

<p>By filtering with an INNER JOIN on the [Date] string against the pre-calculated TargetDate string, I make sure the data set is pared down to the fewest records before doing any math on anything. You'll definitely want to INDEX [Date] to keep this fast as your table fills up.</p>

<p>All these together should give a pretty fast query, good luck </p>

                    --4PM in UTC-5, expressed in minutes
            THEN CONVERT(float,(16-7)*60) --minutes in (4 PM-7 AM) * 60 minutes/hour
        ELSE --Assume nobody is running this at 6 AM, so ELSE = between 7 and 4
            CONVERT(float,60*DATEPART(HOUR, GETUTCDATE()) + DATEPART(MINUTE, GETUTCDATE()) - ((7+5)*60))

             --UTS offset of 5 hours
        END as MinutesToday --Minutes in today's shift so far
        , FORMAT(DATEADD(HOUR,-5,GETUTCDATE()),'MM/dd/yyyy') as TargetDate --Date to search for

<ul>
<li>You want to access to Web Apps using the URL of <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this, how about this answer? I think that you can achieve your goal using Web Apps. As a sample case, I would like to explain about this using a sample script for downloading a text file, when an user accesses to <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>Please do the following flow.</p>

<h3>1. Create new project of Google Apps Script.</h3>

<p>Sample script of Web Apps is a Google Apps Script. So please create a project of Google Apps Script.</p>

<p>If you want to directly create it, please access to <a href=""https://script.new/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://script.new/</a>. In this case, if you are not logged in Google, the log in screen is opened. So please log in to Google. By this, the script editor of Google Apps Script is opened.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare script.</h3>

<p>Please copy and paste the following script (Google Apps Script) to the script editor. This script is for the Web Apps.</p>

<pre><code>function doGet(e) {
  const path = e.pathInfo;
  if (path == ""filename.txt"") {
    const sampleTextData = ""sample"";
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(sampleTextData).downloadAsFile(path);
  }
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(""Wrong path."");
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>In order to retrieve the value of <code>fileName.txt</code> in <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, please use <code>pathInfo</code>.

<ul>
<li>For example, when you check <code>e</code> of <code>doGet(e)</code> by accessing with <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, you can retrieve <code>{""contextPath"":"""",""contentLength"":-1,""parameter"":{},""parameters"":{},""queryString"":"""",""pathInfo"":""fileName.txt""}</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this case, the GET method is used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Deploy Web Apps.</h3>

<ol>
<li>On the script editor, Open a dialog box by ""Publish"" -> ""Deploy as web app"".</li>
<li>Select <strong>""Me""</strong> for <strong>""Execute the app as:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>By this, the script is run as the owner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select <strong>""Anyone, even anonymous""</strong> for <strong>""Who has access to the app:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>In this case, no access token is required to be request. I think that I recommend this setting for your goal.</li>
<li>Of course, you can also use the access token. At that time, please set this to <strong>""Anyone""</strong>. And please include the scope of <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code> and <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> to the access token. These scopes are required to access to Web Apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click ""Deploy"" button as new ""Project version"".</li>
<li>Automatically open a dialog box of ""Authorization required"".

<ol>
<li>Click ""Review Permissions"".</li>
<li>Select own account.</li>
<li>Click ""Advanced"" at ""This app isn't verified"".</li>
<li>Click ""Go to ### project name ###(unsafe)""</li>
<li>Click ""Allow"" button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Click ""OK"".</li>
<li>Copy the URL of Web Apps. It's like <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec</code>.

<ul>
<li><strong>When you modified the Google Apps Script, please redeploy as new version. By this, the modified script is reflected to Web Apps. Please be careful this.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Run the function using Web Apps.</h3>

<p>Please access to <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec/filename.txt</code> using your browser. By this, a text file is downloaded.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>When you modified the script of Web Apps, please redeploy the Web Apps as new version. By this, the latest script is reflected to the Web Apps. Please be careful this.</strong></li>

So, I'll simplify this. The biggest hurdle are the steps to get the refresh token. Once you have that, you can generate countless access tokens that are used to make the actual API calls.</p>

<h1>How To Get Your Refresh Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Login to your Zoho CRM <em>with an admin-level account</em> and have that open in a tab. Then, in another browser tab, login into the Developer API Console: <a href=""https://api-console.zoho.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://api-console.zoho.com/</a></li>
<li>In the Developer API Console, you need to create a Server-Side Client. The fields should be populated like so: <strong>Client Name</strong> (any logical name you want), <strong>Homepage URL</strong> (the homepage of the domain where you're going to be making the API calls, or just use the same URL for where you're doing the redirects), <strong>Authorized Redirect URIs</strong> (put a web page up on the domain where you're going to make the API call and make it emit nothing more than ""zoho confirmed""). (The ""zoho confirmed"" is not required and not mentioned in the docs, but does help you understand the process better.) Click Create.</li>
<li>Once created, click on it again and there's a tab called Client Secret. Click it and record in a notepad your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>.</li>
<li>Take a URL encoder script online (or use PHP or any other tool) and URL encode the following parameters for a new URL you need to compose and load in your browser in the next step:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>scope: ZohoCRM.modules.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.ALL,ZohoCRM.users.ALL,ZohoCRM.org.ALL,aaaserver.profile.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.functions.all,ZohoCRM.notifications.all,ZohoCRM.coql.read,ZohoCRM.files.create,ZohoCRM.bulk.all
response_type: code
access_type: offline
client_id: {use the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {use the Authorized Redirect URI you generated in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>With those URL encoded parameters, pass them to the end of this URL in your browser: <code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?</code> Thus, you would have something similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.ALL%2CZohoCRM.users.ALL%2CZohoCRM.org.ALL%2Caaaserver.profile.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.functions.all%2CZohoCRM.notifications.all%2CZohoCRM.coql.read%2CZohoCRM.files.create%2CZohoCRM.bulk.all&amp;client_id=1000.TTT0BSTTTC9TTTRILR3MGXBYAC82LH&amp;response_type=code&amp;access_type=offline&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%3Azohoconfirm
</code></pre>

<p><em>Please note that if your redirect URI (like <a href=""https://example.com/zohoconfirm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://example.com/zohoconfirm</a>, above) does another redirection with like a 301 or 302 redirect and doesn't also forward those query parameters, then you'll lose the parameters you need to see when finished.</em></p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>Once you load that in your browser, you will see an Accept button. If you do not, then you may have missed that in step 1 you were supposed to login to the CRM in one tab, and then open a new tab to do other tasks. That makes a session open for you and it knows who you are when doing step 5.</p></li>
<li><p>After you click the Accept button, Zoho's account system will redirect you to your Authorized Redirect URI that you specified. So, if you followed these steps exactly, you should see some output like ""zoho confirmed"". But do not close the tab. Look at the URL of the tab and cut/paste it into your notepad. In there, grab that <strong>code</strong> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you have that code parameter, you need to create a special Curl POST request. You can do this either via command line or with your favorite programming language. From command line on Linux, this would look something like the following:</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=1000.aaa1f9aa8582eaaaafeaddfaf0f3b6b.bf7fe646ba899783501c21a9a3240aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fzohoconfirm""
</code></pre>

<p>The URL-encoded parameters you need to fill out are:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: authorization_code
code: {the code you recorded from step 7}
client_id: {the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
client_secret: {the Client Secret you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {the Authorized Redirect URI you recorded in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""9"">
<li>Once you run that Curl command, it will return some JSON that looks similar to the following:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaaa5579abeea73871b096c941ec1df8.7835dbb43bbf5122f2d5810f0b65aaa"",""refresh_token"":""1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""10"">
<li>Now, in the JSON output, you <em>could</em> use that <strong>access_token</strong> to make an API call to generate the lead, but you're better off just taking that <strong>refresh_token</strong> and putting that in a configuration file for later use in your programming. According to their documentation, their refresh_token lasts forever. You should keep this in an extremely secure place.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Get Your Access Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Now that you get your <strong>refresh_token</strong>, you use it to generate a fresh <strong>access_token</strong> each time you need to make an API call. To do that, make another Curl POST with a URL similar to below. In Linux command line with Curl, as an example, here's what it would look like:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=refresh_token&amp;refresh_token=1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa""
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an explanation of how to do the URL-encoded parameters:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: refresh_token
refresh_token: {use the refresh_token (the one I said that would last forever) from your stored config file from step 10 in the previous steps}
client_id: {use your client_id}
client_secret: {use your client_secret} 
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Running the above command should return to you some JSON that looks similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaa1c95788b34226c2844a841bfd1d5.6aff70f4adbc3fee9e6b57579e481aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be storing that <strong>access_token</strong> you received in a temporary variable so that you can make an API call to do something like add a Zoho CRM Lead. That access token will last 3600 seconds (1 hour), but really is of no consequence because you can generate infinite access tokens since you have that refresh_token stored in a configuration file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Create A Zoho CRM Lead</h1>

<ol>
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be using that refresh token to create an access token, and then using it for the following header to pass in your API call:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken XXXXXX
</code></pre>

<p>...where XXXXXX is the access_token you received from the previous set of instructions.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Here's a sample in PHP with file_get_contents (although you can do the same with PHP's Curl) to make a request to add a Zoho CRM Lead. You can take the following example and recode it in your favorite programming language. Change the $sAccessToken value to the one you generated. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note, below, we're also writing into a field called ""Lead Source"", and it's API-accessible name is ""Lead_Source"". (If you end up changing the code below to write into Contacts or Accounts, then you'll want to create a custom field, I'm sure, to indicate where the contact or account came from. For instance, if you have a shopping cart, then you could indicate the record came from completing that transaction, rather than a customer calling in.)</p>

<p>To understand where to find the API-addressable field names, in your CRM, go to: Setup > Developer Space > APIs > API Names > Leads. Choose ""Fields"" from the ""Filter By"" drop-down.</p>

<p>Note that this API does not look for duplicates. You can adapt the above to do an ""upsert"" instead of an ""insert"": <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html</a></p>

<p>If you edit the Contacts and Accounts to have the same custom fields as Leads, then you can change the <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Leads</code> line to <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Contacts</code> or <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Accounts</code> and write entries into those as well.</p>
